Imo Gov. Rochas Okorocha has said that President Muhammadu Buhari will address the nation soon on whether he will seek re-election in 2019. 

Buhari said this Thursday when Okorocha, who is the chairman of the APC Governors Forum, led his group to Aso Rock for a meeting whose major agenda was about 2019.

“It is the desire of the governors that Mr. President should run for this exalted office given his performance in the last two years.  We believe that if he continues Nigeria will be better for it,” said Okorocha.

“in his usual manner”  said the governor, “he has requested that the governors give him time and that he will address the nation and the caucus of the party very soon.”

“So we should be full of expectations that Mr. President will make officially known to Nigerians his intentions but we hope that his response will be in line with what the governors are thinking.”

Okorocha has been mobilizing his colleagues to ensure the president re-contest in 2019. 


First thing Buhari ever tells APC govs urging to run for 2019

The governor has succeeded in making the APC governors commit to giving Buhari automatic endorsement.


But in spite of this and other pressure, Buhari has never declared his intention to run.
