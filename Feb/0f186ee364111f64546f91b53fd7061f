Media adviser to ex-Nigerian President Ibrahim Babangida has sued the Nigerian police for infringing his fundamental human rights after the Force headquarters declared him wanted Sunday night.

Joined in the N1 billion suit are police spokesperson Jimoh Moshood, Channels TV, and the NTA.

The two media houses helped in airing the arrest news.

Afegbua’s legal representative, Kayode Ajulo, filed the suit at the Abuja Division of the Federal High Court Tuesday afternoon.

The lawyer prayed the court to grant an immediate end to the alleged harassment of his client.

Afegbua was declared wanted following two contradictory statements issued on behalf of his boss. The first statement was critical of President Muhammadu Buhari while the second one said to carry Babangida’s signature discredited the first one.

Babangida has however stood by the first statement.
