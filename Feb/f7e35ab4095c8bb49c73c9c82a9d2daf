Police have arrested and paraded no fewer than seven Biafra activists allegedly displaying Biafra’s insignia in a Jewish synagogue Aba, Abia.

The men, however, claimed they were holding a prayer session inside the synagogue.

Abia Commissioner of Police Anthony Ogbizi said in Umuaha the group though outlawed has devised a new strategy to further their agitation for Biafra by joining the same religious group of their leader, Nnamdi Kanu, and using their synagogue as a clandestine meeting place.

Members of the Biafra Independent Movement were also arrested. Ogbizi any organisation that does contrary things will be arrested.

He said the police would not allow any part of Abia to be used as a “breeding ground for terrorists.”

The Ohanaeze Youth Council has, however, called for the immediate release of the Biafra agitators because they have committed no offence to be paraded as criminals.

Mazi Okechukwu Isiguzoro, the national president of the OYC, said the police has no reason to arrest peaceful agitators when armed herdsmen are killing people all over the nation.

He urged the security agencies to go after “murderous herdsmen” who are “known terrorists committing genocide across Nigeria”.

He also asked IGP Ibrahim Idris to order the immediate release of the arrested Biafra activists in order not to create unnecessary tension in the region.
