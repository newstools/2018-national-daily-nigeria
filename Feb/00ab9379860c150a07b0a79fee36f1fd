Leaders of the ruling APC in the south-south have endorsed President Muhammadu Buhari for a second term in 2019.

The party leaders who met yesterday in ABuja were drawn from the geo-political zone which comprises Akwa Ibom, Bayelsa, Cross River, Delta, Edo and Rivers states.

To consolidate their decision, the party leaders have inaugurated a South- South Presidential Campaign Committee with Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State as chairman.

Senators, members of the House of Representatives, states Houses of Assembly, among others, will serve as members.

The all-night meeting was held at the Abuja residence of former Governor of Edo State, Adams Oshiomhole Tuesday night through Wednesday morning.

A communiqué at the end of the meeting was read by the National Vice Chairman of the APC South-South zone, Ntufam Etta.

Buhari has yet to declare his intention to run for office in the 2019 presidential race. But many of his supporters have swung into action setting up campaign offices and machinery while waiting for his declaration.

Leader from the southeast alsi came weeks ago to endorse him as the APC candidate for 2019.
