A motorcycle rider was arrested with five drums of premix fuel. The Tema Marine, Railways and Port Police have arrested three persons including a Chief Fisherman for an attempted diversion of premix fuel from the Tema Fishing Harbour.
The first of the three arrests which were made on separate days occurred on the 15th of this month when the police intercepted an Opel caravan with registration number GT420-W being driven by George Tetteh loaded with two drums of premix fuel. It turned out upon interrogation that a Chief Fisherman, Nii Mattor was behind the diversion.
He was subsequently arrested and currently on police enquiry bail. Again on the 16th of February, the police again intercepted an Opel caravan with registration number GR1175-W with three drums of premix fuel en route to Apam in the Central region.
The owner Emmanuel Larbi was arrested and has been given bail pending investigations. Then on February 22, 2018, the police once again arrested a motorcycle rider who was carrying five drums of premix fuel. The suspect, Patrick Fianu mentioned one Tony as the owner of the premix fuel. Patrick was duly arrested and is still in the police custody while the police continue to look out for Tony, the alleged owner who is currently at large.
Speaking to journalists about the arrest at the Tema Fishing Harbour, the Minister for Fisheries and Aquaculture Development, Elizabeth Afoley Quaye said government is determined to purge the fisheries sector of the rots that is crippling the progress of the sector.
She noted that her outfit is committed to ensuring that the right thing is done and warned that anyone who will be caught in diverting premix fuel will be dealt with according to the law.
Mrs. Quaye commended the police for their vigilance and cautioned the rest of the fisher folks against illegal practices.
