The Vice President, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, yesterday commend the Plateau State Government for bringing on board the Peace Building Agency, for the sole purpose of addressing conflicts, with emphasis on Berom community and the Fulani face off.

Osinbajo stated this at the occasion of the National Summit On Security held in Abuja, recently.

He said, “we are mindful of the Peace-Building efforts of some State Governments in Plateau State, for example, the Government constituted a Peace and Reconciliation Committee to work with the Berom and Fulani communities which had been at loggerheads for years.


“The Government also went ahead to establish the Plateau State Peace Building Agency, the first of its kind by any State Government in Nigeria: Since its creation in 2016, the Agency has fulfilled its mandate of resolving conflicts and tackling the underlying causes and triggers: the results have been encouraging; Plateau State, once the hotbed of ethnic and communal violence in the North Central, has enjoyed a great deal of peace in the last two years”.

The Vice President said that the federal government fully endorses the Peace Building efforts, and will continue to give support and assistance to State Governments in this regard.

“We are also, in collaboration with States, and Governors of Benue, Plateau, Adamawa and along with seven other Governors, working in a group which I chair, where we have been seeking to proffer solutions to some of the problems associated with farmer/herdsmen clashes, but in particular, how to ensure that there is a plan for cattle breeding and rearing which takes into account, contemporary methods of doing so in other parts of the world”, Osinbajo said.

Our correspondent reports that the Plateau Peace Building Agency, through the leadership of its Director General, Joseph Lengmang, has held several stakeholders meeting with security agencies, youths, NGOs, and waring communities fashioning out ways in which to halt the hostilities that has hitherto bedevilled the State.

However, one of it major efforts gave birth to a ‘Five Years Strategic Plan To End Conflict’, which is to be launched in no distant time, Lengmang said.
