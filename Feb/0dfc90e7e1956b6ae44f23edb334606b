Chelsea want a player in exchange if they are to lose the Belgium international
The Blues would rather a young player like Asensio over Cristiano Ronaldo

Real Madrid chiefs are reportedly open to the idea of allowing Marco Asensio to seal a transfer to Chelsea as part of any deal to bring Eden Hazard to the Bernabeu.

According to Don Balon, Blues owner Roman Abramovich is considering his options as he seems to have become resigned to the idea of being forced to let Hazard move to Real.

The Spanish outlet claims Cristiano Ronaldo was considered by Chelsea, and itâ€™s clear the Portuguese superstar could have been a decent short-term fix for the club.

However, Ronaldo has not looked at his best this season and is about to turn 33, so Chelsea may be wise in thinking more long-term by deciding they want Asensio instead.

The 22-year-old Spaniard is one of the most exciting young talents in Europe at the moment, but has struggled to gain as much playing time for Los Blancos this season.
