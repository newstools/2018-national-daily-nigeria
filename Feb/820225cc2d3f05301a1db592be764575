The search for President Muhammadu Buhari’s successor has seemingly placed former President Olusegun Obasanjo and former Head of State Ibrahim Badamosi Babangida on divergent path of finding a suitable credible candidate to challenge the incumbent President in 2019. Both Obasanjo and IBB are untied on the need to change Nigeria’s leadership in 2019 and chart a new course of governance for the country but are relatively divided over who should be supported for the presidential race.

Obasanjo is inclined to support Senator Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso, former Governor of Kano State, while IBB leans towards Governor Waziri Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto State. IBB also has as an alternative option, Abdulazeez Nyako, son of former Governor Murtala Nyako of Adamawa State.

Reliable sources revealed that deep talks are going on to convince Murtala Nyako to allow his son, Abdulazeez, be sponsored for the 2019 presidential race.

Both Tambuwal and Kwankwaso are from the North West, same political zone with President Buhari. Abdulazeez Nyako is from the North East, the zone Pastor Tunde Bakare prophesied the messiah that will redeem Nigeria will come from.

Meanwhile, some retried Buhari in 2019. The negotiations continues which may lead to further probable realignment after the Coalition for Nigeria Movement was inaugurated by Obasanjo.

Aides to the two elder statesmen who also belong to the ruling elite in Nigeria, disclosed that their principals will still have consensus on a particular presidential candidate they wish to sponsor in 2019.
