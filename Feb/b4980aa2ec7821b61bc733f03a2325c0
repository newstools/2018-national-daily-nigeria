Benue State Governor Samuel Ortom has warn his Plateau counterpart Simon Lalung to face his business, and keep off governing Benue.

The exchange took place at a stakeholders’ meeting Sunday night with the National Economic Council Technical Committee on Herdsmen/Farmers’ Crises Resolution which Ebonyi Governor David Umahi chaired.

Lalung has reportedly told Benue Deputy Gov. Benson Abounu that he had warmed Ortom before signing the bill into law back then. Aithough Lalung apologise then, but he told Abounu it was as a result of pressure.

“I am the governor here (Benue); how can he say that he warned me? Who is he to warn me? He can only advise me.”

Speaking at the meeting, the Chairman of the Benue State Traditional Council, HRM Prof. James Ayatse, expressed concerns about the neutrality of the committee since some of its members had at one time or the other taken position on the Benue crisis.

Ayatse was referring to ;a;ung and Kaduna Gov Nasir El-Rufai wjo were said to have made cynical comments concerning the crisis.

“While in pains, a Benue delegation visited President Buhari and the only consolation he could give us was to say, ‘In the name of God, accommodate your fellow countrymen.’ With this statement, how will my people get justice?”

Other who spoke at the meeting included the Catholic Bishop, Makurdi Diocese, Wilfred Anagbe; a former Attorney General and Minister of Justice, Mike Aondoaka, (SAN); and a former commissioner in the state, Mrs. Rebecca Akpedzan.

Also in attendance were President General, Mdzough U Tiv, Chief Edward Ujege; a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Benard Hon; the Chairman, Christian Association of Nigeria, Benue State, Rev. Akpen Negua, and a second-class traditional ruler, Chief A. Abomtse.
