The Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority has set up a four-man team to investigate the alleged incident on Dana Air’s flight Wednesday.

A passenger, Ola Brown, @NaijaFlyerDr, had tweeted, “Flew Dana. Exit door was unstable throughout the flight. As we touched down, it fell off. Scary stuff.”

The General Manager, Public Affairs, NCAA,  Sam Adurogboye said the agency was already on top of the report.

“The affected plane has been certified safe and returned to service but we have set up a four-man team to investigate what actually happened. If the plane was faulty, it would not have been cleared to take off,” he stated.

The airline too has responded In a statement signed by its Media and Communications Manager, Kingsley Ezenwa.

“Dana Air’s attention has been drawn to some online publication that the door of one of our aircraft fell off after landing and while taxing in Abuja today. We wish to state categorically that this could never have happened without a conscious effort by a passenger to open it,” said Ezenwa.

“By design, the emergency exit door of our aircraft are plug-type backed by pressure, which ordinarily cannot fall off without tampering or conscious effort to open by a crew member or passenger. We also wish to enlighten the author that when an aircraft is airborne, it is fully pressurised and there was no way the seat or door could have been ‘shaking’ as insinuated.”

Ezenwa added that a team of DANA engineers and others from the NCAA had inspected the aircraft and no issue was reported.
