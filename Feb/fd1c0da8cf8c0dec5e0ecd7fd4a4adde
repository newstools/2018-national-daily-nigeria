The Federal Capital Territory High Court has for the second time struck out a bail application by Maryam Sanda, daughter-in-law of former Peoples Democratic Party chairman, Haliru Bello.

Justice Yusuf Halilu struck out the application on Wednesday, for lacking merit.

Sanda, who allegedly killed her husband Bilyamin Bello last year, is facing trial on allegations of homicide.

A previous request for bail made by Mrs. Sanda’s lawyer, Joseph Daudu, had been refused in December.

Mr. Daudu made another request on Monday, stating the suspect is pregnant, and is three-month gone.
