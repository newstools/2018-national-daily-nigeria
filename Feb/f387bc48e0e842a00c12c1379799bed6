Borussia Dortmund intend to turn Chelsea striker Michy Batshuayi’s loan move into a permanent deal at the end of the campaign, according to a report.

The Belgium international has made an instant impact in his new surroundings, scoring three goals in two starts since arriving on deadline day.

BVB chiefs are said to have been left so impressed by the 24-year-old that they want him to remain at the Westfalenstadion for the long term.

Batshuayi does not have any right-to-buy clause in his contract, though the London Evening Standard suggests that Dortmund will still open dialogue with Chelsea over retaining the stiker’s services.

The Blues loaned Batshuayi to Dortmund last month as part of a triple transfer that also saw Olivier Giroud move to Stamford Bridge and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang head to Arsenal.
