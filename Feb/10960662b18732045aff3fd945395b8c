The whereabouts of Oriwaye Adefolalu, leader of the Senior Staff Association of Nigerian Universities (SSANU), University of Lagos (UNILAG) chapter, have remained unknown since his arrest.
Operatives of the State Criminal Investigation Department (SCID), Ikeja, had arrested Adefolalu in the wee hours of Thursday.
He was reportedly taken to the Ikeja office of the SCID, where he reportedly met one Adekola Adetomiwa, another union leader, who was also arrested and detained.
On Friday, a source said that the families of the union leaders have been worried as police allegedly refused to disclose his whereabouts.
According to the source, the phone lines of the duo have been unreachable.
It was also gathered that Femi Falana, human rights lawyer, was unable to secure the release of the unionists on Thursday as he was told that “their detention was based on order from above”.
Oluwatoyin Ogundipe, UNILAG vice-chancellor, has been accused of being responsible for their travail.
The institution’s convocation ceremony for the 2016/2017 academic session took place on Friday, after it had been postponed indefinitely, over lingering union crisis.
