The police has called on the public to assist them in searching for the suspects.  The Ghana Police in Tema have launched a manhunt for four suspected armed robbers who attacked and robbed a forex bureau at Tema Community one. Briefing the media, the Public Relations Officer for the Tema Regional Command, ASP Joseph Benefo-Darkwah, said, the suspects fled and left behind a Toyota vehicle after sensing danger. They later snatched a motorbike and sped off with an undisclosed amount of foreign and local currencies. The police therefore called on the public to assist them with information leading to the arrest of the suspects.  ASP Benefo-Darkwah said: “On Tuesday, 20 February 2018 at 5:20pm, police had information that there are four armed men onboard a Toyota Corolla with registration number GR4208-17 and that, they had attacked a forex bureau.
Quickly we sent our patrol team there, on seeing the police; these young men snatched two motor bikes from the public and fled the scene leaving behind their Toyota Corolla.
“When police arrived, we conducted preliminary investigations and we were told by the attendant at the forex bureau that they took unspecified amount of local and foreign currency. On the scene, we were able to retrieve a magazine loaded with one live nine millimeters ammunition and an additional car number plate bearing registration number GR2619-17.”
