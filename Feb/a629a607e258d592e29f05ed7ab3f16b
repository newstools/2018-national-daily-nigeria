Hull City’s Ryan Mason has been forced to retire as a result of the head injury that he picked up playing against Chelsea in January, 2017.

The 26-year-old midfielder suffered a fractured skull after a clash of heads with Gary Cahill at a corner and after 13 months where he has battled to try and return, Mason has had to accept advice from doctors that it would not be safe.

“We announce with profound regret, that due to a head injury, Mason will retire from football with immediate affect,” read a statement from Hull.
