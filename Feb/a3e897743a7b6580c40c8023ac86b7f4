The Ekiti State Governor, Mr Ayodele Fayose has condemned the federal government over reported abduction of 94 pupils of the Government Girls’ Technical College, Dapchi, Yobe State.

Fayose in a statement issued in Ado Ekiti on Thursday, by his Special Assistant on Public Communications and New Media, Lere Olayinka, appealed to the federal government to ensure that the remaining girls were found.

He further called on Buhari’s government to stop lying to Nigerians that the Boko Haram insurgency had been completely defeated.

The statement read “it is painful that despite the earlier claim by the federal government that Boko Haram was “technically defeated” and the latest one that the insurgency was “completely defeated”, 94 students could be abducted in Yobe State in just one day.

“My heart goes to those 46 students that are yet to be found and I urge the federal government as well as the Yobe State government to do all within their powers to bring the students back to their families.

“Most importantly, the federal government should stop lying concerning the fight against Boko Haram insurgents because it has now become the tradition that whenever the government boasts of defeating the insurgents, greater havoc is wrecked on the country”, he said.
