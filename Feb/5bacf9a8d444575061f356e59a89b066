No fewer than 32 persons arrested by the Police in Benue state for allegedly violating the Benue state Open Grazing Prohibition Law are facing trial now.

Commissioner of Police Fatai Owoseni made this known at the weekend in Makurdi.
He also said the command has taken proactive steps to stem killings in the state through visibility policing.

“In order to strengthen our visibility in the state, we have established Tactical Operation Points in 22 locations within Makurdi metropolis. This gives a holistic security coverage to the metro. This was started last Thursday and the 22 points will be covered on 24 hours basis,” he said.

He added 105 persons arrested and arraigned as a result of the civil disturbances recently recorded in Makurdi metropolis, and 11 suspects are facing trial for homicide and mischief by fire which took place in Guma and Logo local government areas.

“We want to assure the people of Benue that we are making use of all the assets of the Police that the Inspector General of Police, IGP, has deployed to the state to ensure that we are able to sustain the gains we have recorded so far.

According to him, there is calmness in the state now.

“And as we are embarking on these operations to get some of these militia out of the places we’ve also been deploying with the additional manpower the IGP gave us in-between last Tuesday and today,” he said.
