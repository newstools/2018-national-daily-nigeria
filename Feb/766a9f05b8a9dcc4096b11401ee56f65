The Apapa Customs Command of the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS), has set a target of about N426 billion revenue in 2018, even as it promised to block all revenue leakages.
Customs Area Controller, Jibrin Musa said the target is equivalent to N35.5 billion monthly, adding that the Command had started on a good note by recording about N31 billion in January this year.
“Judging by the way we started, I believe God’s willing we will do everything within the confines of law to meet and even surpass the 2018 yearly target,” he said.
However, the Command has intercepted four 40 foot containers with nos: MRSU 3637149; MRKU 6196764; MRSU 3516384; allegedly imported by one Villa Gold Pharmacy from India and another one MRKU 6058282, were suspected to contain “controlled drugs”.
Musa said the consignment was intercepted based on intelligence and were examined and found to contain different pharmaceutical products, which are controlled and regulated from importation into Nigeria.
The consignment includeD: 936 cartons of Tramadol Hydrochloride Tablet (225mg); 56 cartons of Collstop Chlorpheniramine Maleate capsule (4mg); 368 cartons of Tramadol capsule BP (120mg); 192 cartons of Tramadol capsules (250mg); 160 cartons of Dobumol Anagestic; 554 cartons of Tramadol capsule BP 120mg and 176 cartons of Col-cap, among others.
According to him, the duty paid value of the 4×40 foot containers stood at N49.9 million.“Worried by the present level of insecurity, one wonders what negative impact would have resulted of the aftermath of these drugs finding their way into the larger society. These could have further aggravate the already tensed situation in the country,” he said.
Musa warned importers and smugglers to desist from illicit trade and comply with the Federal Government’s fiscal policy measures for the economic growth and development of the nation.
Meanwhile, he said the Nigerian Customs Integrated System (NICIS II) training, which was flagged off in other commands of the service, would soon take off in Apapa and the software becomes fully operational.
“We would have blocked all revenue leakages thereby increasing not only our revenue profile but compliance level. I therefore call on all stakeholders who operate within the larger value chain to fully embrace the new application which is faster, more efficient, all-encompassing and will provides opportunity for seamless cargo clearance,” he said.
