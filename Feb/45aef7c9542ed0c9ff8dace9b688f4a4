The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) has suspended an employee for unexplained disappearance of N36m made from sales of scratch cards in the past.
Philomina Chieshe told auditors a snake entered the coffer and swallowed the cash in Makurdi’s JAMB office.

The JAMB Head of Information, Fabian Benjamin, told the Punch on Sunday that the board was taking her through other disciplinary measures while security agencies were investigating the matter.

“She has been suspended and she is going through all other disciplinary procedures while investigation is ongoing on the matter. Her claim was that a snake came into the office and swallowed the N36m proceeds,” said Benjamin.

A team of auditors was said to have been dispatched to different state offices of JAMB to take inventory of sold and unsold scratch cards and recover the generated money.

As investigation continued, Chieshe gave another version of the incident: her housemaid who connived with another woman, Joan Asen, to “spiritually steal the money” from the vault in the accounts office.

The EFCC has moved in following a directive by the Federal Executive Council late last year that JAMB should be investigated.

Chieshe will face more disciplinary actions when the EFCC concludes investigation.
