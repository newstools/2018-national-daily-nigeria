The House of Representatives Committee on Banking and Currency, Wednesday applauded the intervention project of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) at the Administrative Staff College (ASCON), Topo, Badagry, Lagos.

Speaking during the oversight visit of the Committee to CBN intervention projects in the South West geo-political zone, the Committee Chairman, Hon. Jones Onyereri, who led other members of the Committee, said that the Committee was impressed with the progress made in delivering on the project and the use of Nigerian  contractors in the project.

He said, “We are impressed because we didn’t think we can get this kind of outcome judging from our first visit which shows that it will be indeed nice to patronize Nigerian contractors.”

Hon. Onyereri also commended the quality of job done by the contractors and noted that the CBN interventions at ASCON would create a conducive environment for learning, stating that they are worthwhile.

Also in the inspection team were CBN’s Ag. Director, Corporate Communications Department, Mr. Isaac Okorafor, and the Deputy Director in charge of the Projects, Mr. Oluwole Owoeye.

As part of its interventionist policy, the CBN has so far intervened in a number of projects and sectors of the economy, which is currently yielding positive results; notable among them is the Anchor Borrowers’ Programme where it has been able to achieve self sustainability in rice production for the economy.
