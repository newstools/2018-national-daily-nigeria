No fewer than 20 persons  suspected to be members of the outlawed Indigenous People of Biafra, were on Tuesday arrested by the Police in Enugu.

The IPOB members went to heckle them at an event organised by a pan-Igbo group to honour some Igbo personalities, including first President of Nigeria, late Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe.

Things spiralled out of control as one of the Igbo leaders spoke of the need to restructure Nigeria along regional lines.

The organisers of the event tried  to reason with the protesters, but no luck as the activists became violent when it was announced that Azikiwe was to be given a posthumous award for his efforts towards sustaining the unity of the country.

The pro-Biafran agitators condemned  Azikiwe’s ‘nationalist politics, ’blaming  Azikiwe for the current travails of the Igbos in Nigeria.

They would later attack the high table, and some of the dignitaries, damaging a number of cars.

Enugu State Police Command PRO Ebere Amaraizu said “no fewer than 11 were apprehended by the Police.”

They are facing prosecution.
