Head of Service Winifred Oyo-Ita revealed this at the second permanent secretary’s quarterly breakfast meeting in Abuja on Wednesday, adding that 140 passed the exams.

“With this, I am certain, that going forward, the civil service will ventilate itself and officers will be rewarded for hard work.”

She also said the federal government is working hard to review the current minimum wage of N18,000, and a report would soon be presented to President Muhammadu Buhari on the minimum wage issue.

“This meeting also affords the office of the head of the civil service of the federation the opportunity to appraise labour about on-going programme and activities, particularly as it relates to welfare of workers,” she said.

According to her, the permanent secretary, service welfare office has alerted her office about some of the concerns of labour, include work environment.

“To achieve this, I have recently set up a committee on office allocation and expansion with focus on maintenance, rehabilitation and expansion of office allocations to MDAs,” she said, adding that government was “working vigorously on the implementation of Group Life Insurance for workers”.
