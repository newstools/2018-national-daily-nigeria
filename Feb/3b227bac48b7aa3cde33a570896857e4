Yobe State Governor Ibrahim Gaidam’s visit to Dapchi—where Boko Hatam terrorists kidnapped scores of Government Girls Technical College schoolgirls on Monday–turned bloody as residents defied the governor’s security and attack the governors entourage on Thursday.

While some of the girls had been returning to the school, 46 were said to be missing.
In the attack which appeared to have been planned, some of the governor’s aides and even newsmen on tow were injured, and seven vehicles were damaged.

The angry residents said the Yobe State Government deceived Nigerians that the schoolgirls had been rescued when nobody was rescued.

The governor had to leave the town in a hurry to forestall any disaster.

A press statement the state issued Thursday had to retract the initial statement that claimed federal troops rescued 30 of the 46 girls.

As of now, neither the state nor the federal government can confirm the exact number of the missing girls, according to Information Minister Lai Mohammed who asked for time before making any official statement.

The military authorities have also said they were never aware of any rescue operation yet.
