Jose Mourinho is already looking forward to Manchester United’s clash with Liverpool next month – and says the mouthwatering meeting with Jurgen Klopp’s men remains his side’s “special” one.

Both sides claimed victories over the weekend to enhance their top four chances, with the Red Devils second, sitting two points ahead of their Merseyside rivals.

Liverpool defeated West Ham 4-1 at Anfield on Saturday, before Mourinho’s men responded with a 2 goals to a claim a comeback 2-1 success over fellow top-four contenders Chelsea, National Daily reports.

Mourinho, though, believes the clash with the Londoners pales in comparison to Liverpool’s imminent visit.

“It’s any normal game and probably to play Liverpool in a couple of weeks’ time means more because for my club – and of course everyone knows the most important thing is not me – to play Liverpool really has a special meaning,” he said.

“That’s the way I have to look at things. I don’t have any bad feeling in relation to Chelsea to say: ‘Oh, I’m going to prove this and that against my former club.’

“I’m not going to prove anything. In fact, every club I left – by my decision or by the board decision, and Chelsea was the only one (by the board) – I have very good feelings towards them.

“I’ve never played against Inter since I left but I’ve faced Porto, Real Madrid and Chelsea, the feeling is a good one. It’s not a special thing.”

Mourinho added: “The feeling for the fans, that little extra adrenaline, is not about Chelsea, it is more about Liverpool.”
