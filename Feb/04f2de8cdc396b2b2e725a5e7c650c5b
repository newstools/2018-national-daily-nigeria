American musicians Chris Brown and Rihanna who separated years ago on bad terms seem to be getting back together again. They have been spotted together at an event and Chris Brown has tweeted that it is his dream to tour with Rihanna.

Its been nine years since he was arrested for assaulting her in the front seat of his car.

The 28-year-old singer tweeted on Friday (local time) that he would like to join Rihanna for a world tour, which would also feature Beyoncé and Bruno Mars.

In his words:
“Just thinking…. A CRAZY WORLD TOUR would BEYONCE, RIHANNA, BRUNO MARS, CHRIS BROWN. “2 for 2″. And if y’all decide to do it without me… give me 10%” the tweet read.

Chris Brown was arrested for his brutal assault on Rihanna in 2009, following a fight which stemmed from his infidelity.

In June of that year, he pleaded guilty to one count of assault with the intent of doing great bodily injury, for which he was sentenced to five years of probation.

Many of Chris Brown’s million followers on tweeter seem to be surprised at the idea of him reuniting with his former victim.
