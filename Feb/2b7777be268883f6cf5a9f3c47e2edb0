Women across the south-south have threatened to boycott the 2019 presidential election of President Muhammadu Buhari fail to tackle rampaging herdsmen killing and maiming across the nation.

A women, the Concerned Southern Women for Good Governance (CSWG), accused  Buhari of handling the security challenges posed by the herdsmen with kid gloves.

According to the leader of the Aba-based group, Patience Igho, women are a great economic force that a nation cannot ignore as they are at the bottom of the domestic economic growth pyramid.

“The issue of herdsmen attacking and raping our women in the farms will lead to serious food crises in the South. So we women in the South will boycott the presidential election if this menace of herdsmen is not stopped because as it is, no one is talking,” she said on Tuesday.

The CSWG is the first gender-based group to protest the escalating violence by herdsmen against women farmers in Nigeria.

Other groups and ethnic associations have also issued threats.

The Agbekoya in the southwest have said they will handle the killer herdsmen their own way if Buhari refuses to rein them back.
