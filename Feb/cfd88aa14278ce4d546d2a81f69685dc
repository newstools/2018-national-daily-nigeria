Some herdsmen watering their cattle at the only pond in Kinere attacked a villager who challenged them, leading to a mob action by the villagers who killed some of the herdsmen.

The reprisal by the Fulani communities in the area that followed led to sacking of Kinrere, and neighboring Simba and Shure villages, in the Song Local Government Area of Adamawa.

The state Police Public Relations Officer confirmed the incident but said the number of casualties had yet to be ascertained.

Clashes and reprisals have been going on the countryside of the northeastern state. The federal government was forced to deploy maximum military force that led to mass deaths which the Amnesty International has condemned.
