Taraba Governor Darius Ishaku has received a letter by suspected insurgents threatening to overtun the state in ten days’ time.

“We are on notice that in 10 days, we (Taraba) shall be attacked. I have alerted all security agencies. We are waiting, “he told PDP’s Chairman Uche Secondus who paid him a condolence visit Thursday.

Ishaku added that a helicopter has dropped arms and ammunitions in the night without its mission established.

He was referring to an alleged emplacement days ago.

But Taraba State Commissioner of Police David Akinremi had dismissed the report as “an unfounded and misleading rumour.”
