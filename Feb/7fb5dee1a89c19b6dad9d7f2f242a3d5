Suleiman Abdurahaman Kawu Sumaila, Adviser to President Muhammadu Buhari on National Assembly Matters, has insisted that the combined forces of former President Olusegun Obasanjo and Senator Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso can’t stop Buhari from seeking election in 2019.

Sumaila stated this while addressing journalists during the visit of the Vice President, Yemi Osibanjo to Kano State for a private wedding on Saturday.

He said former President Obasanjo has no right to decide for Nigerians whether Buhari should continue or not continue in office beyond 2019.

“If Nigerians decide that President Buhari should run again, Obassanjo certainly has no choice but to concede.” he stated

The Presidential aide assured that Buhari would not be deterred by the ex-President’s statement or by its “underlying motive”, but would remain focused on the goals of the administration and how to make the country better for everybody.

“Whenever there is a piece of advice for a leader, I think the correct thing to do is to pick out what makes sense in the advice and throw away the rubbish thereafter”.

“We, APC, are ready for any eventualities. We are ready for Obasanjo, we are ready for Kwankwaso too,” Sumaila said.
