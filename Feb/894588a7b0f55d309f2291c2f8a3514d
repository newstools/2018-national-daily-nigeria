Emerging commercial airline leader in Nigeria, Air Peace has unveiled a new subsidiary to deepen inter-state air connectivity in the country.
This was made public by the managing director/CEO of Air Peace, Mr. Allen Onyema.
According to him, the establishment of the new subsidiary airline known as Air Peace Hopper, is part of new drive to grow connectivity among local airports that are not currently having access to air transportation.
According to him, Air Peace Hopper, would rely on the new generation 50-seater Embraer 145 jets for its operations.
Explaining the idea behind the new scheme during the reception of one of the six Embraer jets at the Murtala Mohammed International Airport, Lagos, Onyema averred “under Air Peace Hopper, we hope to connect routes such as Benin-Port-Harcourt-Benin; Lagos-Warri-Port-Harcourt-Warri-Lagos; Abuja-Bauchi-Abuja; Lagos-Markurdi-Lagos; Enugu-Kano-Enugu; Lagos-Warri; and Abuja-Warri, among others”.
Continuing, Air Peace boss noted that “We are currently pursuing a massive route expansion project. The birthing of the subsidiary is a milestone in the airline’s vision of uniting Nigeria through air connectivity and ending the travel nightmares of many unserved and underserved cities”.
