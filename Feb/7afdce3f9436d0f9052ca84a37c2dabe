Former military president of Nigeria, Ibrahim Babangida on Sunday recommended state policing as an effective way of combating rising crimes in the country.
IBB who ruled Nigeria from 1985 to 1993 after overthrowing the military administration of Buhari and Tunde Idiagbon stated this in a statement credited to him Sunday.
While advising Buhari not to seek re-election in 2019, IBB citing the diverse nature of the Nigerian society recommended community policing. He said the current policing method cannot yield a new result.
“We need to catch up with modern sophistication in crime detection and crime fighting. Due to the peculiarity of our country, we must begin community policing to close the gaps that presently exist in our policing system. We cannot continue to use old methods and expect new results,” he said.
The former military ruler spoke of herdsmen killings. He listed a number of states where clashes have occurred between farmers and herdsmen. IBB, as he is known by some of his allies, said he is perplexed by “gory themes”. 
The elder statesman said the incident has left him wondering if truly “this is the same country some of us fought to keep together”. To reorient the minds of the herdsmen, IBB said they must be made to embrace ranching as a new and modern way to herd cattle.
Babangida said since “recycling leadership” experimentation has failed, it was about time a new breed of leadership is ushered in. He said starting from 2019, there is the need to enthrone younger blood into the mainstream of political leadership and that the new breed will comprise youth with passion for leadership. 
Admitting that the country has made some progress, IBB said the level of progress is not good enough to place Nigeria on the pedestal it craves for. He spoke on the need to “deliberately provoke” systems and models that will put paid to this recycling leadership.
