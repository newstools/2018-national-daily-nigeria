Diminutive Senator from Kaduna state, Sheu Sani, has vowed he would not stop his criticism of Governor Nasir el-Rufai.
Although, Senator Sani didn’t specifically mention the governor’s name, it was obvious he was reacting to the N2bn suit filed against him by Nasir el-Rufai.
Recall that earlier today, Nasir El-Rufai, governor of Kaduna, had sued Senator Shehu Sani for N2billion. The governor claimed Senator Sani defamed his character by publicly calling him a drunk, loose cannon and an embarrassment to President Muhammadu Buhari.
Governor El-Rufai’s counsel, AbdulHakeem Mustapha, a senior advocate, told journalists who swarmed him on the premises of the High Court that the governor sued Sani for N500 million on each of the charges. He clarified that the governor could sue any citizen.
On his twitter handle, Senator Sani said nothing could stop him from expressing his opinion on Kaduna state or national issues.
Senator Sani and the governor have been arch enemies since the inception of the present administration despite winning elections on the ticket of same party—All Progressives Congress (APC.
Sani had on Channels television labeled El-Rufai a “military administrator and a tyrant” for demolishing a building owned by Senator Suleiman Hunkuyi, who is equally opposed to the governor.
Sani had said:  “What is happening in Kaduna is simply tyranny. We don’t have an elected governor we have a military administrator, one who thinks that everything should go his own way.
“He engineered the party to suspend us, to suspend me. That is about a year and half ago. When the suspension (El-Rufai’s suspension) came, he became very angry moving about bulldozers to bring down buildings.”
