Zinox Group, popularly known for its Information Communication Technology innovative solutions has acquired Konga, one of the largest e-Commerce sites in Nigeria.
The acquisition, in addition to some investments may position Konga as the biggest e-commerce site in the country, effectively ousting Jumia, its longtime rival.
Head Corporate Communications for Zinox Group Gideon Ayogu, noted that the company has had its sights on the e-commerce space in Nigeria for a while now.
He said Zinox had always had an interest in Konga and another big one. “But our priority was konga first because of her integrated nature of four quality companies in one,” he added.
The acquisition of Konga is not the first move for Zinox Technologies as they had previously managed BuyRightAfrica.com. In addition to this, Yudala, an on and offline retail chain is owned by Nnamdi Ekeh, the son of Zinox’s founder. A merger between these two companies may birth an e-Commerce giant.
Konga is a world-class, professionally-run company whose landmark strides in the sector has gone a long way in ushering millions of Nigerians into the ease and convenience of online shopping and boosting the conduct of e-commerce in the country.
Founded in 2012, Konga has struggled to stay afloat in the e-commerce space until 2017, when they announced that the company was now profitable. However, in recent times, most of the company’s operations have been automated, while shifting to a pre-pay only model, stopping Pay on Delivery.
