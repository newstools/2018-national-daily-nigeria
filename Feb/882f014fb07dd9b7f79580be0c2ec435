Emir Muhammadu Sanusi II has been appointed as chairman of the  Kano Investment Advisory Committee which Governor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano recently inaugurated.
Ganduje said the rationale behind the appointment was to take advantage of the personality of the emir, a former governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria.

“We need to take the advantage of his personality around the globe,” he said during inauguration ceremony of the committee, held at Government House, Kano.

Sanusi, too, seemed all too willing to serve—thogh he has always insisted he cherish his throne more than the highest of political posts.

He assured the governor that they would discharge their given responsibilities with all sense of responsibility and ownership. He also commended the governor for the good initiative.

The committee is expected to remove the constraints hindering the progress of the economic potentials of the state, facilitate inflow of foreign and domestic investments, and work with the federal and state governments in addressing concerns that impede the economic progress of the state.

He said the committee would work with private organisations and other relevant organisations to enhance the economic viability of the state.

The committee’s work also includes advising government on the best practices in the economic development of the state, coupled with submitting periodic report to government.

Members of the committee were drawn from the business community, government agencies and the emirate council.

The governor assured them the state government would do everything possible to integrate the committee work with the policy direction of his administration.
