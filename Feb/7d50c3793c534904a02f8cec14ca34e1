The relationship between MINA Miracle and Nina seems to have gone sour as the housemates in the ongoing Big Brother Naija reality show, engaged in serious verbal exchange. Nina, who was Miracle’s strategic partner, is accusing him of sharing their sexual encounter with the other housemates. Nina and Miracle, who were before now strategic partners, have been caught more than once having sex in the Big Brother house.
Both housemates had made viewers understand they knew each other before coming together in the show. But Mina has on Wednesday, told Big Brother that she no longer understands Miracle, who according to her, was a much more calm and very cool guy when they were together. She even thanked Biggie for separating her from Miracle during her diary session. Confronting Miracle for letting out their secret, Nina said, “You have changed a lot. This is not the person I used to know.” This angered Miracle who demanded what exactly he had done wrong. In response, Nina said, “I never knew you talk too much. Why did you tell them that we had sex on camera.
“Our relationship has depreciated and you no longer care about me. I no longer enjoy the relationship the way I used to.” Miracle, however, showed no remorse as he gave reasons they were no longer as close as before. He also told Nina not to jump to the conclusion that she knew him, asking, “For how long did you know me? How can you even say you know me before?”
