Says it will bring anarchy

A retried Commissioner of Police from Benue State, Alhaji Abubakar Tsav, has expressed concerns that establishment of State Police in Nigeria will breed lawlessness among governors of the various states of eh federation.,   

According to Tsav, “The creation of State Police will be the beginning of the disintegration of Nigeria and peace will elude the nation.”

He maintained that “very powerful Governors will become Emperors and there will be no security of tenure for State Commissioners of Police, especially, those who refuse to be used to violate human rights and propagate injustice.”

“We are not yet ripe for State Police.  When were are civilized, tolerant, imbibe fairness with the fear of God; we may be ready for State Police but definitely not with the present crop of Politicians,” Tsav declared.   

He noted that a person like Governor Samuel Ortom can use his State Police to clamp every dissenting voice to jail in Benue State. “No to State Police,” the elder statesman declared.

Vice President Yemi Osinbajo had endorsed the establishment of State Police in the recurring killings by Fulani herdsmen across the various states of Nigeria. Thereafter, Governors subsequently endorsed the idea of State Police.
