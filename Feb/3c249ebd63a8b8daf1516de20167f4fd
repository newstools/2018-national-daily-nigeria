A tiny heart-shaped island in the Adriatic Sea has become a holiday hit for St Valentine’s Day after being discovered on Google Earth. Even the uninhabited island’s owner didn’t realise how perfectly heart-shaped the island off the Croatian coast was until he was swamped with requests from lovers to stay there.

‘It has been incredible. We think it is the most perfect heart-shaped island in the world,’ said Vlado Juresko, whose family owns the 130,000 square yard islet of Galesnjak, hastily renamed “Lovers’ Island”. ‘Nobody lives there so if lovers really do want to spend time alone it’s the perfect desert island. We always thought it looked a bit like a heart but since it’s been on Google Earth everyone else has seen it too and the whole world seems to want to stay here.’
