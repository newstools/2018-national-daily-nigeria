A coalition of 54 youth organisations across the country under the aegis of the ‘Not Too Young to Run Movement’ have given the Presidency, National Assembly and State Houses of Assembly 30 days to conclude all the on-going constitutional amendments as the 2019 election is 365 days away.
Convener of the ‘Not Too Young to Run’ movement, Mr. Samson Itodo made this known while briefing journalists in Abuja on Friday.
He said the movement had declared March 14, 2018 a National Day of Action for Presidential Assent.
Against that backdrop, he called on young people to “prepare as we march to the Presidential Villa to constructively engage with the President on assent to the Age Reduction bill.”
Itodo also called on political parties to uphold the principles of internal democracy, transparency and accountability,
He said: “In the interest of Nigeria’s Democracy, the ‘Not Too Young Too Run’ movement gives the State Assemblies, National Assemblies and the Executive 30 days to conclude the on-going constitutional amendment.
“We urge the state assemblies to without further delay transmit the amendments to the National Assembly.
“We call on President Buhari to assent to the constitutional amendment, especially the Age Reduction bills are transmitted to him for assent. Should the President delay or declines assent to the bill, we call on the National Assembly to veto the President.
“With the passage of ‘Not Too Young to Run’, we expect more youths to seek political office. Whilst noting that parties provide a platform for the actualization of political aspirations, we also not that parties can undermine and jeopardize youth candidacy at elections.
“It is therefore important to reiterate the need for political parties to ensure internal party democracy to safeguard the emergence of youth candidates in the 2019 elections.”
