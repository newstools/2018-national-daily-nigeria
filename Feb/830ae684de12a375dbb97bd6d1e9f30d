Reports have revealed what Real Madrid superstar Cristiano Ronaldo said on his substitution.

Ronaldo was substituted for the first time in eight months on Saturday night.
The Portuguese star was replaced with 10 minutes remaining in the match between his club and Levante.

Isco had just put the visitors in front when Zinedine Zidane brought on Marco Asensio to replace Ronaldo.

Ronaldo had to watch from the sidelines as his side drew the match 2-2.

Following his substitution, the pitch-side photographers had focused on him, a situation he was not happy with.

Reacting to their action, Ronaldo said, “Don’t film me, focus on the game!”
