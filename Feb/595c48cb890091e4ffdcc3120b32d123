The federal government on Sunday said 110 schoolgirls of Government Girls Technical School Dapchi, were unaccounted for in the Boko Haram attack on the school last Monday.
 
Lai Mohammed, minister of information, disclosed this in Damaturu after a closed-door meeting between a federal government delegation, Yobe government, security agencies, community leaders and parents of the missing schoolgirls.
“It was a meeting between stakeholders to get a firsthand information and, out of the total register of 906 students in school that day, 110 students are unaccounted,” he said.
The minister said far-reaching decisions were reached, among which included the deployment of police and Nigeria Civil Defence Corps (NCDC) to all schools.
He said security agencies were synergising to ensure the rescue of every student abducted by the insurgents.
“No stone will be left unturned in our determination to rescue these girls,” the minister assured.
He said the federal, state governments and parents would collaborate with security agents to work towards the successful rescue of the students.
Mohammed said the Boko Haram insurgents were being contained and now looking for soft targets.
He said: “Government will remain focused and resolute in the fight against insurgency to rescue the students and every Nigerian in their custody.”
