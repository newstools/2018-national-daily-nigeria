Midfielder, Henrikh Mkhitaryan, now has the same number of goal assists for Arsenal this season as forward, Alexis Sanchez.

The Armenian international provided three assists on his home debut for Arsenal, as the Gunners thrashed Everton 5-1 at the Emirates Stadium on Saturday in the Premier league.

The 29-year-old joined the North London club last month from Manchester United in a swap deal which saw Alexis Sanchez move in the opposite direction.

Mkhitaryan took just six minutes to lay on Aaaron Ramsey’s opener, latching onto fellow home debutant, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s and lashing a low centre across goal for the Welshman to score.

The Arsenal number 7 man completed his hat-trick of assists with 16 minutes remaining, again firing the ball across the penalty area from the left wing, allowing Aaron Ramsey the chance to sweep home the first treble of his Premier League career.

Meanwhile, Sanchez, who opened his goalscoring account in accidental circumstances for United on Saturday, provided three assists in 19 matches for Arsenal this season and Mkhitaryan has already equaled that tally in the space of 90 minutes.
