The Public Affairs Section of the United States Consulate General has said that the official completion of the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Project (REEEP), funded by United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and Power Africa will be launched on Monday, February 26, 2018 in Lagos State.

Renewable energy is any energy source collected from renewable resources that is naturally replenished, like that derived from solar, wind, geothermal or hydroelectric action. Energy produced from the refining of biomass is also often classified as renewable.

The REEEP initiative, the statement revealed, was introduced in 2014 to facilitate the development and financing of renewable energy and the energy efficiency market in Nigeria.

The project, it stated, also promotes policy changes that improve business conditions.

Consul General F. John Bray will give welcoming remarks at the event which will be attended by representatives of international donor agencies, NGOs, government agencies, lending institutions, and Nigerian renewable energy companies.
