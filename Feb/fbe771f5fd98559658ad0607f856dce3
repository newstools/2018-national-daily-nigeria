A 19-year-old resident of Akyem Tafo in the Eastern Region ran out of luck yesterday when he was spotted trying to take images of female students of AME Zion Senior High School.
The girls, who were taking their bath close to their dormitory readying themselves for the day’s activities, spotted the suspect with a phone at an obscure angle trying to capture them in their undressed state. A naked student who spotted the flash of the camera from an opening of the bathroom, immediately raised an alarm attracting other students who were running helter-skelter as a result.
Male students of the school immediately rushed to the scene and succeeded in apprehending the suspect who by the time was trying to run away. He was subjected to some slaps and handed over to the authorities of the school who in turn lodged an official complaint with the Akyem Tafo Police command. It is still not known what his motivation could be in engaging in such an act but authorities who confirmed the incident to mynewsgh.com said it gives them an opportunity to step up security in the school against intruders
Some female students are however dismayed as they are wondering whether the suspect is in possession of their nude pictures if that was not his first time.
