The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, has reportedly rejected a request by Patience Jonathan, former first lady, to settle out of court in a case involving her and the agency.
According to reliable sources, the anti-graft is insisting on dragging the former first lady to court or enter into a plea bargain “in line with the laws of the land”.
One of the sources said the EFCC believes that an out-of-court settlement suggests that there is a dispute between two parties. “We have considered January 30, 2018, letter by Dame Ibifaka Patience Jonathan; we are of the opinion that her offer of out-of-court settlement is strange and confounding as if there is a dispute between her and the EFCC.
Also, EFCC detectives have not been able to trace about 29 of the 31 individuals and companies which allegedly made controversial deposits into her account.  “We are certainly rejecting the offer from the ex-First Lady because the EFCC does not engage in such a deal.
“But we prefer the ex-First Lady approaching a court for plea bargain in line with the relevant laws if she is ready to settle all issues. The terms of the plea bargain will be open to all parties before the court.
“I think she should emulate other high profile suspects who went to the court for plea bargain. We are ready to apply the laws in the interest of justice for all. We won’t oppose plea bargain.”
