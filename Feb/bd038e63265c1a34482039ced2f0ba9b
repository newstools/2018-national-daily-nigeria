Enugu Governor ‎Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi has sacked 104 of his executive assistants he considered non-performers.

The Governor announced the sack Saturday, expressing dismay over their nonchalant attitude towards the ongoing voters’ registration exercise by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).

Ugwuanyi declared the positions of the affected Executive Assistants vacant and directed them to go back to their various electoral wards to revalidate their mandate before being reappointed.He also regretted many of them had not lived up to their responsibilities in the wards in terms of sensitization, mobilization and promotion of government programmes, policies and interests at the grassroots.
Addressing members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) at the Enugu North Senatorial District Committee meeting of the party held at its zonal office in Nsukka, Gov. Ugwuanyi noted that the INEC voters’ registration was the key to the fortunes of the party and state ahead of 2019 general elections.

The governor also emphasized the need to involve those who are committed to the party and its government in political appointments, especially in choosing executive assistants that will represent them at the ward level.
