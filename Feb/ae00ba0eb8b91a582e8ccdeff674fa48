The chairman of the Code of Conduct Tribunal, Justice Danladi Umar will be arraigned in Court on March 15, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission said.
Umar is being arraigned on charges of demanding and receiving favour from a defendant standing trial before the CCT in 2012.
The EFCC, through a private lawyer, Festus Keyamo, had on February 2, 2018, filed the charges against Umar before the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja.
The case which has been assigned to Justice Ishaq Bello on Wednesday has been fixed for March 15.
The prosecution in the case marked, CR/109/18, accused Umar of demanding N10m as favour from a defendant standing trial before the CCT, Rasheed Owolabi Taiwo, in 2012.
The anti-corruption agency also accused Umar of receiving, through his personal assistant, Gambo Abdullahi, the sum of N1.8m from Taiwo in the same year.
The offences were said to be contrary to Section 12(1)(a) & (b) of the Corrupt Practices and other related Offences Act, 2003.
