Fulani herders in Ekiti have taken oath to ensure peaceful coexistence with the host communities in Ekiti .

The oath was administered by Alhaji Ardo Mairero, the Sarkin Fulani of Kwara State after a peace meeting chaired by Governor Ayodele Fayose.

The traditional oath was taken with kolanut , a symbol of covenant that the herdsmen in Ekiti would not kill, rape, and allow their cows to stray into farms.

“It is a Fulani tradition that is binding on the  initiators. With this oath, issues of robbery, killing, damaging of farms and kidnapping among others being allegedly perpetuated by Fulani herders are over in the state,” Fayose’s Chief Press Secretary Idowu Adelusi said.

Traditional oath taking becomes significant when the covenant is broken, and the consequences are mostly tragic.

The governor had a peace meeting on Monday through Tuesday with the Emir of Kano, Alhaji Muhammadu Sanusi 11, represented ex-Gov Ibrahim Shekarau, the National President of the Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria, Alhaji Muhammadu Kiruwa, heads of security and law enforcement agencies, hunters, members of MACBAN, farmers, vigilantes and grazing enforcement marshals.

“The meeting and signing  of the memorandum by all parties lasted for two hours between 11pm on Monday 19 and  1am of Tuesday, February 20, “ he said.

The oath is also expected to be binding across the southwestern region.
