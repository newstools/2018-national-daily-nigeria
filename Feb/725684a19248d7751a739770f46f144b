The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has to increase daily supply of petrol to 100 million litres throughout the month of February to find lasting solution to the fuel scarcity that has persisted in the past five months across Nigeria.
 
Accordingly, the Corporation targets placing order on two vessels of petrol per day till the end of February 2018.
 
The NNPC projects that one vessel will have capacity for 50 million litres, thus, the two vessels will bring in 100 million litres to increase supply and service the daily needs.
It was gathered that 45 million litres of petrol was offloaded into jetties across the country on Wednesday.

Record shows that before the 45 million litres discharge, there was 324 million litres of petrol on land and 432 million litres in marine storage, making a total of 756 million litres, which is believed can serve for 22 days at 35 million daily consumption rate.

The jetties that received the 45 million litres shipments include Nacj, Apapa; Bop, Apapa; Techo Jetty, Lagos; Dutchess, Oghara; Vine Jetty, Calabar; Chipet Jetty, Lagos; and ECM Jetty, Calabar.
