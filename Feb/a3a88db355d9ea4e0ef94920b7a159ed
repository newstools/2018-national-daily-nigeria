Imo Governor Rochas Okorocha has said he would support his son-in-law, Uche Nwosu, to be governor in 2019 if he decides to contest—no matter.

Nwosu, who is currently the governor’s chief of staff, is married to Okorocha’s first daughter, Ulomma.

Okorocha was quoted to have said this when leaders of the All Progressives Congress from Owerri Municipal Council visited him on Monday.

The APC leaders’ visit, according to a press statement by the governor’s chief press secretary, Sam Onwuemeodo, was to urge Okorocha to encourage Nwosu to be the next governor.

“Uche Nwosu is hardworking, and never gets tired. He is a very humble young man. Not proud. Not arrogant. So, power won’t enter his head,’ Okorocha said.

“In spite of the position he occupies, you can’t see him quarreling with anybody or maltreating anybody.

“He does not segregate anybody, whether from Orlu or Owerri or Okigwe zone. He relates with people enviously.”

Though his son-in-law has not declared his intention to run for governor of the state, if he (Nwosu) comes out, Okorocha he will support him on the grounds that he has all it takes to make a good governor.

“What the state wants is Imo governor and not Owerri Zone or Orlu Zone or Okigwe Zone governor. Zoning does not put food on the table of anybody.” Okorocha said.

“The young man is a team player who does not use his office to molest anybody. He has the qualities of a good leader. If he says he will run for governor, I will support him.”
