“In the life of a nation, there are occasions when citizens must “forgo personal pleasures or pay the ultimate price” for the progress and unity of the nation.”

That was President Muhammadu Buhari statement while discussing with the Senior Citizens in Katsina on Sunday.

He particularly asked the elite to be prepared to make sacrifices as a foundation for national growth and development.

Buhari has been known to be against the elite over the years, and his position on wealth distribution, many believe, had worked against him in his 12-year quest to govern Nigeria.

That position, however, gives him a cult following in the north where the figures are
stacked against the majority in terms of poverty.

‘‘The Nigeria of our time is in need of sacrifices by all citizens to free it from corruption, poverty, crime and underdevelopment,’’ Shehu qouted Buhari as saying to the group led by Gov. Aminu Masari.

He thanked the members of the forum for complementing his administration’s efforts at national development.

The president further assured them that the security of lives, property and prosperity of all Nigerians remains uppermost in his heart.

Masari said the delegation was in the President’s country home to condole with him on the death of two members of his extended family.

The Emir of Daura, Alhaji Umar Faruk, the Galadima of Katsina and retired former President of Court of Appeal, Justice Mamman Nasir were among those who attended the meeting.

Meanwhile, the Emir of Maradun in Zamfara, Alhaji Garba Tambari, who also paid a condolence visit to the President pledged the unflinching support of the traditional institution to Federal government policies and programmes geared toward improving the welfare of Nigerians.
