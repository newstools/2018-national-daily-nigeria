Chelsea’s new striker, Olivier Giroud has revealed what he likes about his new manager, Antonio Conte, after joining from Arsenal on deadline day.

The 31-year-old who will wear the No.18 shirt at Stamford Bridge, was signed for £18million.

The French international was in the stands as the Blues were humbled 3-0 by Bournemouth on Wednesday evening.

Upon joining Chelsea, Giroud was asked what he likes about Conte, and he said, “I don’t know him very well obviously but I like the positive energy he brings to the pitch.

“He’s always supporting his players, talking to them. Communication is massive in football, for me the relationship with the coach is very important.

“Tactically, he is obviously very good because he’s Italian – Chelsea is a strong team defensively and quite efficient up front with great players. I think I will enjoy it.”
