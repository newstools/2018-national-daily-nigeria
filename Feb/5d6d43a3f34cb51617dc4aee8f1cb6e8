The Jamaican sprinter, Usain Bolt, 31, and 100-metre world record holder, has declared his intention to end his athletics career and change to football game.
Bolt had retired from athletics last summer after his defeat in the gold medal competition in the last Olympics. Though he had a successful career in athletics; he won eight Olympic gold medals.
The world champion had always talked of his intention to play football on retirement from track events. Bolt had on Sunday, tweeted: “I’ve signed for a football team! Find out which one this Tuesday at 8am GMT.” This confirmed the change of career of the world fastest sprinter to football.
Bolt is a lifelong Manchester United fan.
Bolt was expected to go for a trial with Bundesliga club, Borussia Dortmund, next month. He was said to have had training with South African club, Mamelodi Sundowns, last month.
Bolt was gathered to have declared in January: “It’s something that I want to do.
“In March we’re going to do trials with Dortmund and that will determine what I do with that career, which way it goes.
“If they say I’m good, and that I need a bit of training, I’ll do it.
“It makes me nervous. I don’t get nervous but this is different, this is football now. It’ll take time to adjust but once I play a few times, I’ll get used to it. It was the same when I started track and field.
“I was nervous for a while until I started getting used to the crowd, people and everyone around and it falls into place.
“One of my biggest dreams is to sign for Manchester United. If Dortmund say I’m good enough, I’ll crack on and train hard.
“I’ve spoken to Alex Ferguson and I told him he needs to put in a good word. He told me if I get fit and ready; he will see what he can do.”
