She wrote, “I am grateful … but I will forfeit the posts, calls, gifts, and messages for their safe return. And so, I ask that you pray for them, instead of a post for me. “Drop a prayer, I know you already wish me well… pray for every missing child. Please, this is the best gift you can give me. #prayinsteadofpost #bringthemhome.” Fans who were overwhelmed by her soft heart and kind gestures quickly flooded her page with prayers for the missing girls.
