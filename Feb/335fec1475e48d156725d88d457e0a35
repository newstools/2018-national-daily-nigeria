Coach of Iran national team, Carlos Queiroz, has called on FIFA to ban Argentina captain, Lionel Messi, from playing at the 2018 World Cup until it is confirmed he is human.

Queiroz is preparing to lead Iran to their second World Cup finals this year in Russia.

They will face Spain, Portugal and Morocco in Group B, while Nigeria will face Messi’s Argentina, Croatia and Iceland.

“I’ve always said that Messi is an extraordinary player. He’s out of this world. If he were human, he wouldn’t have had that magical moment in that match (Argentina beat Iran in the group phase with a late Messi goal),” Queiroz told FIFA.com referring to Iran’s 1-0 loss to Argentina at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.

“I don’t usually like losing, but I didn’t come away from that defeat with a negative feeling.

“It’s when something magical like that happens that you know that football is alive and kicking, and that’s why it’s one of the best sports in the world to watch.

“And it’s even more of a special moment when it comes from a player who shouldn’t be allowed to play by FIFA until it’s proven that he’s actually human.”
