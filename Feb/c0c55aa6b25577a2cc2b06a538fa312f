Mothers have been warned to desist from bathing their new born babies with hot water as it could cause high temperature.
Community health technician, Hellen Bulu gave the advice while advising women against bathing their new born baby with hot water said, it is also unhealthy to pull infants’ hands in an attempt to massage them.
According to her, it was typical of African women to bath their newborns with hot water and also stretch their hands without knowing the implications.
She revealed this while speaking at a lecture to mothers at an immunization programme in Abuja.
Bulu said that God who put the baby in their womb had already done the needful, adding that bathing newborn with hot water can cause high temperature.
Mothers, she advised, should desist from stretching the hands of their newborns, adding that the practice is only common to Africans.
Bulu also advised mothers to breastfeed newborns rather than apply hot water when a baby has high temperature, saying, the more you breastfeed the baby, the more the temperature comes down.
“If the baby’s body swell up, do not apply hot water or rub liniment;  just keep looking at the baby’s body, it will come down after a while,’’ said the expert.
She, however, said that if the high temperature persists, the best thing to do is to visit the hospital, adding that it can be a sign of fever.
Besides, she advised that women should embark on family planning within six weeks after delivery, stressing that family planning after six weeks is ineffective.
