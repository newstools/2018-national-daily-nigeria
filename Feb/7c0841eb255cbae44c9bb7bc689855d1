Ogun State government is strengthening its anti-land grabbing law to end the menace of the farmers/herdsmen clashes in the state which ot said has become a national issue.

Yewa North was said to be the worst hit by the farmers-herdsmen violence.

Secretary to the State Government Taiwo Adeoluwa briefed newsmen yesterday about the decisions reached at the State Executive meeting on security situation in the state.

Governor Ibikunle Amosun was represented at the meeting by his deputy, Mrs Yetunde Onanuga.

At the security meeting were Comptroller of Nigeria Immigration Service, Muhammed Harande, state Director, Directorate of State Services, Alade Bankole, Commander, 35 Artillery Alamala, Abeokuta, Brig. Gen. Basil Adonkie, state Commandant, Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, Olusola Ayodele and Commander, Vigilante  Service of Ogun State, Soji Gonzalo.

While reviewing the security situation in the state, Adeoluwa said there had been huge reduction in violent crimes such as armed robbery, kidnapping and cultism.

But a spike in the herdsmen violence began weeks ago when a truckload of herdsmen came into the state from Kwara, having been invited by a traditional ruler claiming a long-time tie.
