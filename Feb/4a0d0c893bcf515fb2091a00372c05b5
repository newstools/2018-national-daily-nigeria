The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), is set to roll-out sanctions on the six interconnect companies allegedly involved in call masking in the Nigerian telecoms industry, before the end of next week.
The regulator had few weeks ago, invited the companies where they were shown exhibits of their infractions and asked to go home and write their defence on why they should not be sanctioned accordingly.
It was learnt on Thursday that the review of their defence submissions by NCC showed all six affected companies erred in the regulations and therefore would be sanctioned accordingly.
However, additional details suggested that NCC is working on handing down varying degree of sanctions including a 90-day trac depending on the severity of every company’s level of breach.
Otherwise, Blockade may be imposed on interconnect companies allegedly involved in call masking in the Nigerian telecoms industry.
The six affected interconnect clearing companies include Interconnect Clearinghouse Nigeria Limited, Medallion Communications Limited, Niconnx Communication Limited, Breeze Micro Limited, Solid Interconnectivity and Exchange Telecommunications Limited, were alleged to have been implicated.
