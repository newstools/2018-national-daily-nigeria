One of the two suspects in the murder of a member of the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) has been released less than a week after the prime suspect named him in the crime.

Akani Olorunwa, an ex-chairman of the NURTW on the agreement he had with the police that he will make himself available for further interrogation.

The prime suspect Adeola Williams(aka Ade Lawyer) had told the police Olorunwa, offering N1,5 million,  employed him to assassinate the chairman of the Idumota Branch of the association Azziz Lawal aka Kunle Poly.

But Ade Lawyer accidentally shot Lawal’s P.A Ganiyu Ayinla aka Pinero in January.

As of two days after Olrunwa’s release, Lagos State Police Public Relations Officer Chike Godwin Oti, claimed he had not been briefed about the release of the murder suspect.  

He had told the National Daily on Monday the police won’t take them to court yet.

“We will do that as soon as we conclude investigation which is still going on.”
