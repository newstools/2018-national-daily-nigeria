Investigation have reavealed that the nation’s epileptic power situation is getting no better as Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN), suffered about six systems collapses in January 2018.
The damage of nine vital components, expected to gulp about N3.85 billion to procure relevant equipment and rehabilitate within nine months.
The equipment include 1x150mva, 330/132kv T1A Mitsubishi power transformer in Jos, which was completely burnt, and will take N850 million to replace.
Also badly damaged was the 1x30mva, 330/33kv T2 Toshiba transformer at Gusau substation, which would require N300 million for a total replacement.
Other damaged equipment include: 1x100mva, 330/33kv SPECO power transformer at Ejigbo substation, 1x60mva, 132/33kv ABB power transformer at Katampe substation, 1x60mva, 132/33kv power transformer at Aja substation, 1x60mva, 132/33kv power transformer at Benin substation, and a 1x60mva, 132/33kv power transformer at Okene substation, were completely lost.
Additional details suggest that TCN had been losing serious vital components throughout last but were not reported.
Analysts traced the regular collapse of national grid to irregular monitoring and maintenance nationwide, saying a technical agency like TCN deserves a highly technical personnel, preferably an electrical engineer, as managing director and not a graduate of Accountancy with additional degree in Business Administration like, Mr. Usman Gur Mohammed, the current Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer.
