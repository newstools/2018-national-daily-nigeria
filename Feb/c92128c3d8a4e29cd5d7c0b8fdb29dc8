Debunks that snake swallowed the money

The controversy of the mystery snake swallowing N36 million from the Joint Admission and Matriculation Board (JAMB) office is taking a new dimension.

A Sales Clerk in JAMB Office, Philomena Chiesche, who was said to have claimed that snake swallowed N36 million realized from sales of scratch cards revealed that JAMB only forged 
the snake story to cover up the N36 million fraud.
 
In an interview with Cable News Network (CNN), Chiesche had owned up that she was never questioned about the money and never said that the money was swallowed by a snake.

“I did not say any money was swallowed by a snake. Nobody questioned me about that case. I am just a clerk and I serve under directors who are accounting officers. I wonder why they are personalizing the case,” Chieshe had told CNN.

The spokesperson of JAMB, Fabian Benjamin, was reported to have said that there was indeed a case of fraud and criminality JAMB office in Benue State, hence ordered that the sale of scratch cares be stopped to curb corruption.

The earlier report was that Chieshe told JAMB registrar and his team that she could not account for N36 million she made in previous years before the abolition of scratch cards.

Philomena was then said to have denied the allegations that she stole the money but confessed that her housemaid connived with another JAMB staff, Joan Asen, to “spiritually” (through a snake) steal the money from the vault in the accounting office”, the report had indicated.

The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission had vowed that it will “show no mercy” to the alleged snake that swallowed the sum of N36 million at the Makurdi, Benue State office of the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board.
