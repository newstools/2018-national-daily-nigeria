Jeremy Corbyn has claimed that Arsenal are now in “a much better place” after selling Alexis Sanchez to Manchester United.

During the January transfer window, Arsenal allowed Sanchez to join United – rather than letting the Chilean leave on a free transfer in the summer – while also agreeing a new contract with Mesut Ozil.

The Labour leader – who is a long-time supporter of the Gunners – feels that the North London outfit should be pleased with their business at the start of 2018.

Corbyn told Youtube channel COPA90: “I was happy that Arsenal got, eventually, what we wanted and that the endless debate about Alexis Sanchez was over and he finally moved.

“I was really pleased when Alexis came and I thought him and Ozil linking up together – and then eventually with Lacazette – could have been a brilliant combination, but clearly Alexis wanted to go.

“I am also very pleased that Ozil has signed a longer-term contract, so I think we are in a much better place.”

Arsenal also sold Theo Walcott and Olivier Giroud to Everton and Chelsea respectively, while signing Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang.
