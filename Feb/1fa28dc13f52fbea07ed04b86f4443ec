Chelsea head coach Antonio Conte has revealed that he has a number of selection problems ahead of the club’s FA Cup fifth round clash with Hull City.

David Luiz and Ross Barkley again miss out through injury, as does Tiemoue Bakayoko who was absent from Monday’s 3-0 triumph over West Bromwich Albion through suspension.

Conte has also suggested that he has further fitness issues ahead of welcoming the Tigers to Stamford Bridge on Friday night.

At a press conference, the 48-year-old told reporters: “Bakayoko is out, Luiz and Barkley are out as well. We have a couple of situations we have to check before the game.”

Conte is likely to make several changes to his starting lineup with the West Londoners facing Barcelona in the Champions League next week.
