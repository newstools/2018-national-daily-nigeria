FirstBank Plc has issued an alert on the activities of unscrupulous individuals who have made attempts to scam unsuspecting members of the public using short codes bearing the Bank’s name.
In a message to all its customers, FirstBank warned customers to disregard requests by individuals seeking for account information such as account numbers, card numbers, token codes, PINs, One Time Password (OTP), etc, from its customers.
According to the message, which reads in part, the bank emphasised that “We would like to draw your attention to text messages being sent using short codes bearing the bank’s name. Some of these mails also request that customers update their account records by clicking on links to fake internet banking website.”
The bank advised customers to shun such requests even as it cautioned that internet banking accounts, ATM details and PIN are confidential, hence must not be disclosed to anyone, insisting that the bank would never make such demands of its customers.
“While from time to time FirstBank may use this channel to reach its valued customers, the bank will never on any of such platforms request for account information such as account numbers, card numbers, token codes, PINs, One Time Password (OTP), etc from its customers”
It therefore advised customers to report all of such text messages and calls claiming to be from the Bank, suggesting possible deactivation of accounts or soliciting for account information through the Bank’s official contact email and call centre numbers, to abuse@firstbanknigeria.comor 01-4485500
