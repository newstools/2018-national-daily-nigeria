The Yobe state police command has dismissed the claim of the army that Dapchi, headquarters of Busari local government was left in its care before the withdrawal of troops.

Onyema Nwachukwu, spokesman of Operation Lafiya Dole theatre command, had said troops handed over the town to the police before withdrawing.

Nwachukwu said this in response to the comment of Ibrahim Gaidam, governor of Yobe state, that the withdrawal of troops made Boko Haram insurgents kidnap 110 students from Government Technical Science School, Dapchi.

But Sumonu Abdulmaliki, commissioner of police in the state, said Nwachukwu’s statement did not reflect the true situation.

“The statement by the Military of formal handing over of Dapchi town to the Nigeria Police Division in Dapchi is not correct and untrue, as there was no time that the military informed the police of their withdrawal, consult or handed over their locations in Dapchi town to the police,” he said.

“The whole of Yobe state is still under security emergency which the police, the military and other security agencies are battling to ensure lasting peace. Members of the public in Yobe state are implored to disregard and discountenance this claim that the military formally handed the security of Dapchi town to the Nigeria Police as untrue, unfounded and misleading.

“The Yobe state police command will continue to cooperate with other security agencies in ensuring safety and protection of lives and property of the people of the state.”
