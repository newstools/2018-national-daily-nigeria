The National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) John Odigie-Oyegun has reaffirmed his support for the party’s national leader Bola Tinubu whining that Oyegun was frustrating his reconciliation assignment.
“It is most challenging but I believe you will ultimately justify the confidence reposed in you by Mr President. In this, you have my fullest support,” said Oyegun in his Fen 23 response.
Tinubu wrote Oyegun Wednesday expressing worries that his “presidential assignment” of reconciling members of the party was being sabotaged by the chairman.
According to the former governor, Oyegun‎ positioned himself in active opposition to the goal of resuscitating the progressive and democratic nature of APC.
‎Mr. Odigie-Oyegun rejected that allegation in his response copied principal officers of NASS and presidency.
The party chairman simply reiterated his support for the ex-Lagos governor’s reconciliation efforts, wishing him good health and God’s strength.
Weeks ago, President Mulammadu Buhari commissioned Tinubu to reconcile the fragmented ruling party, and Tinubu had hit the ground running until February 21 when he hit a snag allegedly masterminded by the chairman.
‎”Instead of being a bulwark of support as promised, you positioned yourself in active opposition to the goal of resuscitating the progressive and democratic nature of APC,” Tinubu said in the letter copied Buhari and others.

The two had been close political allies until 2015 primary for Ondo’s governorship election where Tinubu believed his candidate Segun Abraham was shortchanged by Oyegun.
