A secondary schoolteacher in the Aguata Local Government Area of Anambra, has led his 17-year-old sister down the isle.

God told him to do so.

Chiadikobi Ezeibekwe said he had a revelation where God told him to marry his sister.

He did a bit of Bible-thumbing to drive home his point.

“One advantage of doing this is that it discourages divorce. It also retains family values and norms,” he told the Punch.

The wedding was conducted by Dzeibekwe’s elder brother, Chijioke who is the  priest of Dwelling Fullness of God Church, Agba.

But the village youth angered by the incest set the church on fire.

Ezeibekwe said he did not pay any bride price to anybody in respect of the marriage.

“I don’t feel guilty. I don’t feel ashamed. I don’t feel intimidated in any way. Only God can stop us,” he told the newspaper.

The eldest son of the family, Emeka Ezeibekwe, vowed to resist their union.

The traditional prime minister of Ekwulobia said, “Agba village youths, who saw the marriage as  an abomination,  set ablaze the church where the wedding took place.

“I restrained them from further action against the man and his family.  If it were in the past, the entire family would be burnt down because this is a grave abomination and sin,” said Gabriel Ezeukwu,
