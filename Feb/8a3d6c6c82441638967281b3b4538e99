Some supporters of the All Progressives Congress (APC) rallied in Abuja Friday, asking party chairman  John Oyegun to resign because they have lost confidence in him.

This took place a day after the party’s national leader Bola Tinubu visited the party headquarters as to kick-start his conciliatory assignment President Muhammadu Buhari.

The protesters under the aegis of “Buhari for Victory 2019 Initiative” held placards with inscriptions such as: ‘Oyegun is a threat to Buhari’s reelection’, ‘Oyegun Must Resign Now’, ‘Oyegun is dividing APC.’

Leading the protest at the party’s national secretariat in Abuja was Toyin Raheem, a chairmanship aspirant of Orile Agege Local Council Development area of Lagos, to the party’s national secretariat in Abuja.

Police officers guarding the secretariat prevented them from gaining access to the office.
Oyegun and Tinubu met during the week in a new move to unite the fragmented ruling party.

The two leaders fell apart in 2015 after the Ondo guber primary election.
