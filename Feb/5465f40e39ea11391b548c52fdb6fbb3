A new military campaign across the north-central will kick off February 15, and it will be tackling the rising spates of killing, kidnapping, herdsmen violence, and other menaces across the middle belt.

The Nigerian Army said Exercise Ayem Akpatuma will be covering Benue, Taraba, Kogi, Nasarawa, Kaduna and Niger.

The Chief of Training and Operations, Maj Gen David Ahmadu, who announced this in Abuja on behalf of the Chief of Army Staff, Lt Gen Tukur Buratai, said the exercise would run from February 15 to March 31, 2018.

According to the army, Exercise Ayem Akpatuma, which is said to be the Tiv language for cat race, will involve raids, cordon and search operations, road blocks, show of force and checkpoints.

Many have criticised the federal government for launching  military campaigns against the Indigenous People of Biafra and the Niger Delta militants while sparing Fulani herdsmen whose violence has been on the up.
