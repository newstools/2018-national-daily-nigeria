A Lagos lawmaker Hon. David Setonji has reacted to the news making the round that the new role assigned to the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu is a crooked attempt to rubbish his person, stating that he is the only one with the required pedigree to stem the lingering crisis in the party.

The Certified Engineer turned politician, hinted that no matter what political detractors say about Asiwaju, it would not rub off his competence in crisis management.

“Politics and democracy are about crisis management, it is not out of place,that he is deployed to reconcile the aggrieved the team would deliver because and this would affect our electoral fortune as a political party.

“It is better to jawjaw than war war and they know the man has the clout to do the task, so that assignment is not out of place.

He noted that on the contrary the assignment is not a ploy to debase Asiwaju and that the timing was perfect.

“You can always get back to him,there was no major crisis two years ago may be we have been managing it but now it has gone out of proportion and we felt we need somebody of his status and pedigree to do that.

“Asiwaju is our leader and if not for him the President won’t have been President today ,he is not God but God has used him because you have to be a candidate before becoming a President and somebody fought vehemently. to ensure your emergence as a candidate.

“That comes first thank God we are going to amend our constitution now and we will have independent candidates but before you become an independent candidate you must follow certain process”.Setonji said.
