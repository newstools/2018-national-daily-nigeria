The Governor of Ondo State, Arakunrin Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, as part of the activities marking the celebration of his one year in office, disbursed loans at single digit interest rates to 180 market women across the 18 local government areas of Ondo State.
Governor Akeredolu, represented by his Wife, Arabinrin Betty Anyanwu-Akeredolu, at the event at the International Events Centre (Dome), Akure, reiterated the determination of his administration to continue to support women with such loans in order to improve their businesses. He further stated that the goal is to ensure that the women break the circle of poverty and attain high standard of living.
Arakunrin Akeredolu also enjoined the women to make judicious use of the loan to improve their businesses and pay back within 13 months period given them so that other women can benefit from the programme.
He noted that the gesture was to help solve the challenge most women face in securing loans as they are required to provide collateral in order to get help.
The chairman of Micro Credit Agency, J A Folayemi, represented by the General Manager of the agency commended the Akeredolu administration for embarking on programmes that positively touch the lives of the people.
While lauding the Governor for the initiative, he also charged the women to make use of the funds and pay back as at when due so that others can have the opportunity to benefit as well.
Present at the event were Chief Judge, Mrs. Oluwatoyin Akeredolu; Commissioner for Women Affairs, Wunmi Olatunji Edet; Commissioner for Local Government and Chieftancy Affairs, Lola Fagbemi; Senior Special Assistant on Women Affairs, Mrs. Titi Adeyemi; Special Assistant on Special Duties, Barr. Henry Adegbemile; Special Assistant on Gender, Research and Documentation, Mrs. Temitope Daniyan; and other top government functionaries.
