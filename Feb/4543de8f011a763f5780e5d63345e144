For most pet owners, the idea of never seeing their beloved pets ever again is too upsetting to even think about.

They are part of the family, and life without them just wouldn’t be the same.

Debra Suierveld is no exception, and when her black labrador Abby disappeared from the family home in 2008 she was absolutely heartbroken.

She did everything she could to find her, but she had completely disappeared.
So Debra just had to assume the worse, and began to mourn.

But ten years later, 12-year-old Abby turned up about ten miles away on George Speiring’s front porch in Apollo, Pennsylvania.

He took her to the Animal Protectors of Alleghany Valley organisation who scanned her microchip and contacted Debra.

Speaking to the Tribune Review , she said: “I didn’t even know what to say. I was like, ‘Oh my goodness.’

“She kind of came back from the dead. We mourned her.”


But the family, who are planning a welcome home party for Abby, have a bizarre theory about where she has been for the last ten years, reports CBS .
