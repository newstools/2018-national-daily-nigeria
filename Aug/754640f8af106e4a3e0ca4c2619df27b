The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on Tuesday assured the returnee Senate President Bukola Saraki, Governor Megida Ahmed Abdulfatah of Kwara State and the Nigerian Ambassador to South Africa, Alhaji Ahmed Ibeto, of fairness as they rejoined their original political party.
PDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, in a statement in Abuja declared: “The party says the coming of Senator Saraki, Governor Ahmed and Alhaji Ibeto could not have been at a better time than this when our nation requires the input of genuine patriots that will save her from an impending decline.
“The PDP notes the harassment and intimidation that the duo of Senator Saraki and Governor Ahmed had suffered from the lords in the disintegrating All Progressives Congress (APC) which they helped to build and nurtured to win elections.
“Senator Saraki, in particular, has conducted the affairs of the Senate in reflection of the wishes of the silent majority of Nigerians and had emerged a hero of democracy.
“The party has no doubts that Senator Saraki, Governor Ahmed and Alhaji Ibeto will contribute immensely to the new order that engender good governance in our nation.
“The PDP assures all returning members of all the rights and privileges accruable to every member of our party.
“Furthermore, the PDP calls on all Nigerians who are desirous of rescuing our nation from the incompetent administration of President Buhari to rally with party of choice, PDP, ahead of the 2019 elections.”
