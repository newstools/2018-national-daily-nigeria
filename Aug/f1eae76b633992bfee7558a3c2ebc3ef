The irreconcilable dispute between the State Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Lagos, Moshood Salvador, and the prominent party leader in the South West, bode George, forced Salvador to defect to the All Progressives Congress (APC). Salvador at his residence in Surulere, Lagos, on Monday, announced that he decamped with over 10,000 PDP members in the state to APC.
 The former PDP State Chairman complained that he was no longer comfortable with “greedy leaders who are fond of telling lies and destabilising the party for their selfish interest”.
Salvador was arrested over a murder case and prosecuted with 10 other persons until the court exonerated him from the allegations. Thereafter, the former State Chairman accused former PDP National Vice Chairman, South West, Chief Olabode George, of being behind his travail.
National Daily gathered that Salvador and George have been involved in power tussle over party control.
The former PDP State Chairman was remanded in Kirikiri prisons in July on his arraignment at a Yaba Chief Magistrates’ Court with 10 other suspects on a two-count charge of conspiracy and unlawful killing.
They were being prosecuted for the murder of Adeniyi Aborishade, Chairman, PDP Apapa Local Government Area, who was killed on July 21, 2018 during the party’s visitation meeting held at Igbosuku Village, Eti-Osa Local Government Area.
A Lagos High Court, Ikeja, however, dismissed the murder charge and Salvador was set free; thereafter, he defected to APC.
