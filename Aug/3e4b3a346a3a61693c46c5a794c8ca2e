Says three years not enough to change Nigeria




The national leader of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, in Lagos, chided critics of President Muhammadu Buhari on his poor performance in the past three years. Tinubu was of the view that three years are not enough Buhari to re-engineer the country and, thus, not sufficient basis to judge the performance of the Buhari administration.
The former Governor of Lagos State, emphasised that the previous administration looted Nigeria’s treasury meant for successive governments to grow and develop the country. He, however, argued that despite the looting, President Buhari is gradually restoring the hope of Nigerians.
Tinubu had declared: “Three years is not enough time for retouching, redevelopment and re-engineering the country. There is a lot of hope, there is a lot of expectation.
“The vision of president will not take a magical touch to bring it to reality. It takes patience and perseverance.
“Nigerians adopted democracy; we are going to live through this democratic government. We need a President Buhari to retool and re-engineer, that is what he is doing in the economy and he is doing it gradually, otherwise we don’t want it to fall apart again.
“Previous governments ate the seed of growth for breakfast. Therefore, there is nothing for lunch or dinner. Nothing to harvest that is why we talk about looters.
“Economic development and the future of the youth are crucial in the growth of any nation and we are taking care of that. You have to re-grow the economy, re-engineer it from bottom, during that process; it is always very difficult for ordinary people,”
“We were meticulous, dedicated and focused and we lifted the spirits of our people and that is why it is important for Nigerians to be focused now.”
Tinubu appealed to Nigerians to keep hope in the APC government to deliver it’s campaign promises.
