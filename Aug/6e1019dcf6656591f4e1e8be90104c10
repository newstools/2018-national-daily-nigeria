Nigeria today escaped an impending FIFA ban after the federal government wrote the world football governing body declaring that it recognised Amaju Pinnick-led NFF board as the true board in charge of football administration in the country,National Daily gathered.
Senior Special Assistant to the Vice President on Media and Publicity, Laolu Akande, disclosed this in his twitter account earlier today.
According to him, “The FG has already conveyed to FIFA its firm position recognizing Amaju Pinnick-led NFF as the current & only NFF Exco. Govt will also continue to work with all relevant stakeholders involved to resolve dispute in a timely manner. FG is upholding NFF treaty obligations to FIFA.”
The response came after FIFA had last week threatened to ban Nigeria from all football related matters if it fails to settle the endemic crisis that has engulfed the football house in the country and communicated back to it.
National Daily learnt that FIFA gave the government till 12noon today to communicate back to it or face ban.
However, what remains to be seen is how the two persons, Chris Giwa who is recognised by the Supreme Court of Nigeria and Amaju Pinnick who is recognised by FIFA but have been in court over the NFF presidency, will settle scores.
As at the time of this report, neither of the camps have spoken on the latest development.
It is expected that with the resolution, Nigeria football leagues which have been in hiatus will resume soon.
NFF election is scheduled to hold on September 20, 2018
