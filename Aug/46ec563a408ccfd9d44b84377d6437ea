Former Leicester City forward Ahmed Musa had a debut to remember for Saudi Arabia outfit Al Nassr by scoring the winner in their 2-1 win over Al Jazira‎ in a round of 32 game of the Arab Champions League,National Daily gathered.
Signed from Leicester City for a fee in the region of a little over £17m, the Nigeria international wasted no time in proving his worth to the club with the winner after coming in as a substitute in the second half.
His pace was a constant threat to the defence of the UAE side, and his goal came with just 15 minutes left to play in the game and it was enough to give his side a much needed win and also helped Musa make an instant impact.
Musa didn’t have the best of time in England with Leicester City and even had to return to CSKA Moscow on loan 18 months after his move to the then English Premier League champions.
The move revitalised his confidence and he was by far Nigeria’s best player at the World Cup in Russia with his two goals against Iceland handing Nigeria their only win at the World Cup ‎2018 in Russia.
