Atiku, Sen. Bruce condemn action

The demolition of the Radio Station in Ibadan, Oyo State, belonging to a music star, Yinka Ayefele, on Sunday by the Oyo State Government has continued to generate caustic criticisms against Governor Abiola Ajimobi.
Earlier, SERAP had condemned the demolition, threatening to challenge the action in court if the state government fails to pay compensations to affected victims.
Former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, a presidential aspirant on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), condemning the demolition stated:  “the reports of the demolition of a radio station in Oyo fills me with a deep sadness. Press freedom is sacrosanct. It’s equally saddening that at a time when jobs are badly needed, a radio station which was providing jobs is needlessly demolished.”
Also, Senator Ben Bruce chided the Oyo State Government. He declared: “If Yinka Ayefele had built that radio station in England or America, he would have received an award. He built it in Nigeria to provide jobs and he received bulldozers instead. Yet we say we want investors.”

National Daily recalls that Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State had in the political rift with senators in the state, demolished the resident of Senator Suleiman Hunkuyi without proper legal proceeding.
More so, Governor Al-Makura of Nassarawa State demolished Breeze FM Radio Station.
Governor Ajimobi of Oyo State joined the demolition trend with the Ayefele’s Fresh FM Radio Station in Ibadan on Sunday.
