After years of holidays from political killings and cultists violence since the administration of Governor Udom Emmanuel in Akwa Ibom, terror and violent activities are beginning to resurface in the state, threatening the security of lives and property. The cult boys Governor Udom Emmanuel has sent on holidays are regrouping to terrorise Akwa Ibom State with sophisticated weapons.
Suspected members of Iceland cult group, at the weekend, kidnapped a national Youth Service Corps (NYSC) member, Akpanabia Udoworen, in his village, Nto Okon Usung Itike, Ukanafun Local Government Area, Akwa Ibom State.
National Daily gathered that Udoworen, serving in Birni Kebi, Kebi State, had visited his parents after completing his mandatory orientation exercise and was discharged from the camp last Friday.
It was said that the cultists invaded the Udoworen family compound on three motorbikes and took him away; the Corp member was identified as the son of the president of a prominent socio-cultural organisation, Esop Ikpaisong Afaha, in Ukanafun.
A family source was cited to have narrated that, “He arrived on Friday and the following day, Saturday, the hoodlums got wind of his arrival and stormed the compound at Nto Okon Usung Itike, and whisked him away after brandishing AK-47 rifles and machetes.”
The Iceland cult groups were said to have been kidnapping for ransom in that part of the state, compelling Governor Udom Emmanuel to outlaw at least 33 cult groups in Akwa Ibom.
