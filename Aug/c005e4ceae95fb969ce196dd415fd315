NFF Extraordinary General Assembly held in Benin City  recently where several resolutions were made to help return normalcy to Nigeria Football, the Osun State FA Chairman  vividly dismissed any notion of there ever being a fraction or crisis within the NFF Glass House.
Taiwo Ogunjobi told National Daily “ I am so passionate about grassroots football because that was where I also came out from.”
He however refused to comment on the bribery allegations towards Coach Salisu Yussuf as investigations by the NFF Ethics Committee was ongoing and he would rather wait for the outcome of the investigation that preempt on what the Coach did or did not do wrong.
He concluded by dismissing any notions on a crisis rocking the NFF and also the idea that there was any fraction by describing what was going on within the NFF as a family affair which was already been looked into even as he back the Super Falconet to make the Nation proud in France at the FIFA Under-20 Woman World Cup.
