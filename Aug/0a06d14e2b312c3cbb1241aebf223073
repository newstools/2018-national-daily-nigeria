Mexican police have found cocaine worth thousands of dollars hidden inside more than a dozen bread rolls during an airport drugs raid.
Sniffer dogs helped anti-narcotics officers make the discovery at the international airport in Guadalajara, a major city in the west of the country.
Each of the 15 rolls was filled with a bag containing 120g of cocaine, which was found with the help of sniffer dogs.
The market value of the illegal drug is around $150 (£116) per gram, meaning there would have been approximately $270,000 (£209,000) of it hiding in the rolls.
Much of the cocaine sourced in Mexico is usually bound for the US, with officials having to deal with an increase in the number of small shipments at airports.
It comes as the country continues to endure an unprecedented spate of murders linked to its war on drugs.
