After an awful World cup outing which saw the defending champions crash out of the group stage, Jerome has been on the books of Man Utd boss Jose Mourinho weighing up options to bring the veteran defender to the club after a disappointing show from the Rojo and Smalling which paved a wide gap in terms of point to the reigning premier league champions, Manchester City.
Despite rumors linking the Bayern Munich defender back to Paris Saint German and Manchester city where he had once been sent on loan, Mourinho looked the most likely to acquire his services.
The veteran defender has now decided against joining Manchester United because he does not think they can win the Champions League this season, according to Sky sources in Germany.
The Bayern Munich defender spoke to United boss Jose Mourinho earlier this week to explain he was honored by United’s interest in him but would not be moving to Old Trafford.
Boateng’s aim is to win one more Champions League title – the former Manchester City full-back won the trophy in his first season with Bayern in 2013.
However, Boateng will turn 30 in September and he feels United are not among the contenders to lift the trophy in Madrid next year
It now looks likely he will stay at Bayern
Boateng has a very good relationship with new coach Niko Kovac who hails from the same district in Berlin.
Boateng also feels Kovac appreciates him as a player although he could still move to PSG if they can match his terms – a decision is expected soon.
