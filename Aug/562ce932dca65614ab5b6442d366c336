Plateau United FC Technical Advisor, Coach Kennedy Boboye has told National Daily about the loss of several key members of his squad to foreign clubs as the players sort to take their careers to the next level.
“We have loss four key regular players in my team to foreign clubs: Peter Eneji, Emaka Umeh both players to As Trencin in Slovakia while Rapheal Ayangwa just signed for Ik start in Norway while Okemuute Odah is in Saudi Arabia any moments from now his document will be release to the club in Saudi Arabia, Even
The coach however concluded by saying he had no indispensable players as he believed the fringe players would come in to fill the void perfectly because his philosophy at Plateau United or any of his previous teams he had coached was never to have any players who had a guaranteed starting shirt.
In Plateau United nobody, he said, is guaranteed a starting shirt.
“You work hard in training to play any match.”
It could recalled that Coach Boboye played fifteen good years  outside the shores of this country–Germany , France, Belgium, United Arab Emirates , Saudi Arabia and as well South Africa–before  he finally say good bye to round leather game to become a football coach.
