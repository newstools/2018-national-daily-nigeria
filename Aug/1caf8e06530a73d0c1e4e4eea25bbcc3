With the stiff competition for the 12 available seats on the final flight to Tenerife, Spain for the 2018 FIBA World Cup amongst the 22 players presently in camp, the assistant coach of D’Tigress, Peter Ahmedu says picking the final squad will be a difficult task,National Daily gathered.
Speaking from their Atlanta, USA camp as preparation hots up, he said the mood has been at an all-time high with players on the same page with the Technical crew.
“It has been a difficult one for us here because of the level of competition between the new and the old fighting to pick up shirts to the world championship in Spain. The players are competing hard in order to pick a shirt and make it to the second phase of the screening which will eventually be in Lagos from the 19th of August.
Ahmedu said the recall of 10 players out of the 12 that won the 2017 Afrobasket Championship in Mali has impacted greatly on the continued development of the team.
“We hope by the time we get back to Nigeria, we are going to have the inclusion of Akashili and Akaraiwe to see what they can bring into the team before we depart Nigeria for the final phase of preparation which hopefully will be in Turkey.”
The current Head coach of First Bank Basketball Club of Lagos assured that the Technical Crew led by Sam Vincent is working round the clock to produce the best 12 players that Nigeria will be proud of at the World Cup.
