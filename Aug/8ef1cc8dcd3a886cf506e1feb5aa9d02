An 83 years old Imam of Nghar Village, Gashishi District of Barkin Ladi Local Government Area, Plateau State had in the turmoil of the mass killings by Fulani herdsmen in the state taken the risk to save 300 people believed to be Christians fleeing the death zones.
National Daily gathered that the Imam saved about 300 persons on June 24, 2018, when Fulani Herdsmen invaded about 15 communities in Barkin Ladi LGA where they killed hundreds of persons.  The Imam had hidden the female supposed refugees in his residence, while he took the male to the Mosques to guarantee their safety.
“I hid the women in my personal house and after that, I took the men into the Mosque and hid them there,” Iman Abubakar had narrated.
The indigenes were running to escape being killed by the ravaging herdsmen who invaded their Villages in the Barkin Ladi LGA when the Imam beckoned on them to turn to his residence where he hid them in his house and Mosque for safety.

Meanwhile, National Daily gathered that President Muhammadu Buhari has, in recognition of the patriotic action of the Imam, approved the conferment of national honourary award on Imam Abubakar.
