Manchester United beat Manchester City in April to delay their title celebrations
Premier League champions Manchester City are a “rich club” but “cannot buy class”, says Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho,National Daily gathered.
Mourinho was responding to a question about City’s £10m Amazon Prime documentary All or Nothing, which was released earlier this week.
Manchester United  Manager said: “I think you can have a fantastic movie, respecting others. You don’t need to be disrespectful.”
A film crew was given behind-the-scenes access – including to the dressing room – for an eight-part documentary about City.
Jose said: “I haven’t seen it but I know a few things about the movie. My reaction is if you are a rich club you can buy top players, you cannot buy class. That is my first reaction.
“The second reaction is because I am in the movie, I could ask for some royalties.”National Daily learnt.
Mourinho added: “You know, a movie without me doesn’t sell much. I needed to be there.
“But if they send me one of the shirts they had in the tunnel when we played there, the shirts that were saying: ‘We did it on derby day.’
