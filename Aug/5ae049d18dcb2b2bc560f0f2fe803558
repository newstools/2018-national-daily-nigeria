Chris Giwa has been told to stop parading himself as President of Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) as he never won any election into the board of the nation’s soccer federation,National Daily gathered
This is coming from Opukiri Jones Ere, who served as Special Assistant ( technical) to Danagogo, the minister of sports who was in charge in 2014 when the NFF drama played out in Abuja.
Ere who saw it all then told  National Daily that members of the NFF Congress who were supposed to vote at Chida Hotels, Abuja were no where near the hotel when the so called election which Giwa is holding on to took place.
“Who were those that voted in the election? Some of us who saw it all can not continue to keep quiet? I was Danagogo’s SA technical then. I can tell you that the federal government then didn’t recognize the election, FIFA on its part did not and members of the NFF congress didn’t.
“Congress members were at the police station to get Aminu Maigari out of police net when the so called election took place. I saw it all and my position is that it is wrong in the first place for anybody to use what happened that night at Chida hotels to hold the nation and her football to ransom. Enough is enough,” he said.
Jones stated that both the sports ministry and FIFA endorsed and monitored the Warri election which Pinnick won. He stressed that rather than fight Amaju Pinnick,the incumbent sports minister, Solomon Dalung should have been celebrating him for what he has succeeded in achieving in African and world football.
“Amaju is today the second most powerful person in African football. He has risen to FIFA level and he didn’t just go alone. He has succeeded in carrying many Nigerians along. To me, Amaju should be celebrated rather than being crucified,” the SA  said.
