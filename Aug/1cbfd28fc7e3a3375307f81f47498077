Lionel Messi has been named the new captain of Barcelona following Andres Iniesta’s departure from Camp Nou, National Daily can report.
The Argentina international, who already wears the armband for his country, takes over from Iniesta following his move to Vissel Kobe at the end of the 2017-18 campaign.
Messi has skippered the Blaugrana on numerous occasions before having been the official vice-captain since 2015, but will now lead the Liga champions out on a permanent basis.
Sergio Busquets takes over as vice-captain while Gerard Pique and Sergi Roberto have joined the four-man leadership team, with the quartet all having come through La Masia before graduating to the first-team.
Messi will be hopeful of lifting his first trophy as captain on Sunday as Ernesto Valverde’s side take on Sevilla in the Spanish Supercopa.
And with silverware having again evaded his grasp at international level during the World Cup, the five-time Ballon d’Or winner will be keen to be lifting more trophies over the next 12 months.
