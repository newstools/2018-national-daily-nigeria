After seeing Mateo Kovacic leave this summer, Real Madrid captain Sergio Ramos is reportedly keen to see the midfield strengthened before the transfer deadline.
The Croatian international joined Chelsea on loan earlier this month, and the reigning European champions have yet to fill the void that he leaves behind.
There is an argument to suggest that they don’t need to given he was used sparingly for the most part, and Julen Lopetegui still boasts options such as Toni Kroos, Luka Modric, Casemiro and Isco in that department.
However, according to Don Balon, Ramos isn’t quite convinced that it’s enough as there is a counter-argument to suggest that given Real Madrid will be competing on multiple fronts again this season, any strength and depth added to the squad will be welcomed.
As per the report, the Spaniard would welcome former Barcelona ace Thiago Alcantara joining, albeit the Bayern Munich star has a €60m valuation.
This isn’t the first time that the 27-year-old has been linked with a move to the Bernabeu either, as Sky Sports have previously paired the club with an interest in him this summer.
It would seem to make sense from the perspective that Lopetegui knows him well having worked together in the Spain set-up over the years and so he could be well suited to the game that the Spanish tactician is looking to implement this season which has already seen them place more of an emphasis on possession.
Nevertheless, it’s one thing Ramos reportedly wanting the signing and the club actually going for Thiago, with Don Balon adding that club president Florentino Perez is also getting his finances in order to launch a bid for Neymar next summer.
Time will tell if Thiago is a late signing, but with just over 48 hours to go until the transfer deadline in Spain, Real Madrid will surely have to speed things up.
