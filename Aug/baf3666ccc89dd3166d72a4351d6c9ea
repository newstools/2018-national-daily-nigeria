The European Union has cautioned the securities agencies against being used by politicians for partisan assignments in the power struggle between political parties and the preparations for 2019 general elections.
The EU in a statement condemned the   Tuesday barricade of the National Assembly by operatives of the Department of State Security (DSS), admonishing security agencies to desist from partisan use of state resources.
The EU maintained that security agencies must be fair and professional in their conduct, particularly, in this season of preparations for the 2019 general elections. The Union assured of continuous support for the growth of democracy in Nigeria.
The statement read: “The EU Heads of Missions have noted with concern recent examples of interference in the democratic process by law enforcement services – the most recent case being the barring of access to the National Assembly on August 7, 2018.
“The EU is fully committed to supporting democracy in Nigeria, and it commends the Federal Government’s swift action to protect the independence of the National Assembly as a critical pillar of democracy.
“The EU reiterates the importance of all law enforcement services staying neutral and ensuring that independent institutions can operate in line with their constitutional mandates, free from interference and intimidation.
“The upcoming general elections in 2019 are vital in ensuring national stability, peace and prosperity for all Nigerians. It is for the Nigerian people to decide the outcome of the elections, and the EU calls upon all stakeholders in Nigeria to play their part so that voters can make their decision through a free, fair, credible and peaceful election process.”
