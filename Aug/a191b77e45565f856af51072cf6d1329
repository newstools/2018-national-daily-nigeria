Amid reports that Barcelona will revisit their interest in Paul Pogba in January, it’s been claimed they’ll have to splash out a significant fee to sign the Man Utd superstar.
As per The Guardian, the World Cup winner raised doubts over his future at Old Trafford this month after conceding that he isn’t entirely happy while it’s added that a reported deal was agreed with Barca via his agent, Mino Raiola.
In turn, speculation has already been rife, and with the Red Devils continuing to struggle having fallen to back-to-back defeats against Brighton and Tottenham in the Premier League, it has led to further question marks being raised.
The Express report that although Barcelona have conceded defeat in their hopes of signing Pogba before Friday’s transfer deadline in Spain, they will try again in January to prise the French international away from United, and he could also be ready to force a move through.
A departure this month was always unlikely given United’s inability to sign a replacement after the August 9 deadline for Premier League clubs, but it seems as though they’ll face a fresh fight in the New Year to keep hold of their influential midfielder.
Now, Don Balon have claimed that it will take around €120m to convince United to sell in January and it’s a fee that Barcelona are capable of shelling out.
Albeit Ernesto Valverde already has quality options in that department with the likes of Sergio Busquets, Ivan Rakitic and Arturo Vidal, all three are now over 30, and so Pogba, 25, could be an ideal long-term solution for the La Liga champions.
Nevertheless, time will tell if an agreement can be reached between the two clubs first as Man Utd will surely have no interest in allowing one of their most important figures to leave unless they have a capable replacement already in mind.
