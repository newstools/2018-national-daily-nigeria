President of Coaches Association, Ladan Bosso  revealed to National Daily his  view of  events with regards to one of their members and national team coach, Salisu Yusuf .
He said that  as a body they hold to FIFA ethical rules and as such, persons bound by the FIFA Code of Ethics may only offer or accept gifts or any other benefits to and from persons within or outside FIFA, or in conjunction with intermediaries or related parties as defined in the Code.
Coach Bosso told National Daily that “It is a good resolution which serves to bring the family back and be more united which would allow the football calendar in the country flow.”
The Ifeanyi Ubah Technical Advisor while describing his own period of FIFA ban said it was not an experience he would want any other person or group of persons to have.
Ladan revealed that they as a body would however sanction the Coach Salisu if he is indeed found guilty of bribery.”
Coaches Association said, the bribery allegations towards one of Nigeria’s Elite Coaches
we  have made a statement after the issue came out so I would like to wait until the Ethics Committee comes out with the results of their investigation.
On a personal note he however expressed sympathy to the Chief Coach of the Super Eagles describing his decision to accept the gift as a decision he would also make.
But he chastised the coach for lack of judgment in his verbal agreement to receiving 15% of the contract should the player get signed.
