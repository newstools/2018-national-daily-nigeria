Five-time Ballon d’Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo did not disappoint his fans as he scored within eight minutes into his Juventus debut game — a friendly between the club’s senior team and the team ‘B’. However, the match had to be abandoned as the fans of the ace Portuguese footballer invaded the ground. The match had been played for 72 minutes, and the scoreline read 5-0, when it was called off and the senior side declared winners.
On Sunday, thousands of fans flocked to the stadium to catch a glimpse of CR7 at the small town of Villar Perosa outside of Turin, where the pre-season friendly match was played.
Cristiano Ronaldo, who moved from Real Madrid to Old Lady last month, scored his first goal while playing for Juventus’ senior side.
After the match was abandoned, Juventus manager Massimiliano Allegri said, “What matters most now are matters on the pitch.”
“The ambition is obviously to go as far as possible in the Champions League, but as always, the Coppa Italia and the Scudetto are also essential to us, because nobody gives out trophies until you earn them on the field,” Allegri added.
“Regarding [Cristiano] Ronaldo, I can say that we have bought a great player on the pitch, but above all, I was told that he is a superb professional, and that is certainly the case. If he wasn’t, he would not have achieved what he has done.”
Cristiano Ronaldo will make his official debut in Serie A against Chievo on Saturday, 18 August.
