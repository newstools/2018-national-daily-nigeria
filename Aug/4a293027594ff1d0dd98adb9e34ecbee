From the hundreds of players that started the screening process to be a part of the Nigeria Golden Eagles, 40 players on Monday were made to undergo the mandatory MRI Age Scan to ascertain their eligibility to feature for the Nigeria U-17 team in an official tournament.
The team management had earlier hoped that 60 players would be screened using the MRI age scan, but only 40 slots have so far been allocated for screening of the Golden Eaglet hopefuls.
National Daily gathered  that 23 of the 60 players screened the last time the MRI Age Scan was conducted failed the scan.
However players who scale this hurdle and make it into the final 23-man team to represent the country in Tanzania would still have to face a final MRI Age Scan hurdle should the Golden Eaglets qualify from their CAF U-17 qualification group where they face Cote d’Ivoire, Burkina Faso and Benin Republic.
The Qualifiers is scheduled to start September 2nd 2018 in Niger and only the overall winners of the zonal qualifiers will advance to the tournament scheduled to hold in Tanzania next year.
