The alliance with the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and 36 other political parties to form the CUPP, suffers setback as the Labour Party (LP) makes marginal exit from the Coalition. Thus, the cohesion of the coalition is becoming unsustainable.
National Daily gathered that LP factional National Chairman, Dr. Mike Omotosho, at a public lecture in Ilorin, Kwara State, during the inauguration of the ward and local government canvassers of APC, said that it is not impossible for the Labour Party to adopt President Muhammadu Buhari as a presidential candidate if Buhari would work for the uplift of the masses. He had maintained that the Labour Party has preference for the welfare of the downtrodden and the masses.
He further vowed that LP will deliver 16 million votes for the re-election of President Buhari.
Omotosho had declared: “I am particularly delighted that Alhaji Lai Mohammed is already working towards getting 16 million votes. I want to assure you that with the Labour Party in support of this project, we are bringing an extra 16 million votes from the workers.
“However, we are still talking. For us in the Labour Party, it is about the masses. As long as the ideals of the Labour Party will be implemented and protected, we are on board.
“I bring them good tidings from the over 16 million workers of the Labour Party. We will bring 16 million votes to President Buhari. That is the vote we have.”
