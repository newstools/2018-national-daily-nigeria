The Acting President, Professor Yemi Osinbajo at the State House Abuja, condemned the illicit and undemocratic actions of masked State Security Service (SSS) who invaded and occupied the National Assembly in the early hours of Tuesday. The Acting President maintained that the blockade of the National Assembly gates by operatives of the State Security Service (SSS) was unauthorized.
National Daily gathered that Osinbajo further described the action as a gross violation of constitutional order, rule of law and all accepted notions of law and order.
“The unlawful act which was done without the knowledge of the Presidency is condemnable and completely unacceptable,” Osinbajo said.
A statement issued by Laolu Akande, Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Office of the Acting President, affirmed that the action of the SSS was not authorised by the presidency.
Osinbajo assured Nigerians that all persons within the law enforcement apparatus who participated in this travesty would be identified and subjected to appropriate disciplinary action.
The acting president had earlier sacked Lawal Daura, the SSS DG  and directed him to hand over to the most senior person in the organization.
Daura was appointed by President Muhammadu Buhari on July 2, 2015, after the dismissal of Ita Ekpeyong.
