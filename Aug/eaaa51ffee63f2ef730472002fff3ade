Dr. Dakuku Peterside, Director General (DG) of the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA), is still perfecting his strategies to unseat Governor Nyesom Wike of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the 2019 governorship election in Rivers State.
Peterside, the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) defeated by Wike in 2015, in a media interaction in Lagos, revealed that he is still dotting ‘I’s; and crossing the ‘T’s’ before making formal declaration for the 2019 governorship election in Rivers State, saying that he is currently ‘’consulting’’ with the key stakeholders in the state. He maintained that he would make formal declaration after the consultations, on whether he will contest again or not.
Peterside further stated that APC National Executive Committee (NEC) would determine whether the governorship and other primary elections for the party’s tickets would be direct or delegate.
The NIMASA DG also protested that there is often a “mismatch” in reportage of Rivers politics relating to the huge financial inflow into the State, which include the Internally Generated Revenue (IGR); the State’s share of Paris Club debts over-payment refund among others, in juxtaposition with the achievements claimed by Governor Wike. He was of the view that the Wike administration performance has been blown out of proportion.
He further remarked that since Wike assumed office as the Governor, he has not advertised any project, except the World Bank assisted water project.
