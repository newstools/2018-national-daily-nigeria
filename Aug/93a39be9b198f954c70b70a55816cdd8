Says Buhari is unhealthy, held captive by a cabal




Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal of Sokoto State has indicated his interest to join the 2019 presidential race. The governor also took a swipe on President Muhammadu Buhari, who he said has been facing health challenges, paving way for a cabal to be controlling the Buhari administration.
National Daily learnt that speaking to youths, including students at the Governor’s Office who were a solidarity rally in appreciation of the inclusive youths participation in his administration, Governor Tambuwal declared: “We supported Muhammadu Buhari in 2015 to become President unconditionally and we admit that Buhari has integrity but that’s not the only requirement for leadership.
“We are aware that the President is affected by serious challenges of health and is being held captive by a cabal that runs Nigeria for their personal interests.
“I have been under intense pressure from various quarters in Nigeria, including, leaders of the country and friends of Nigeria outside the country to contest the presidency.
“But leadership is a collective decision and I have never asked to be made a leader at any time in my life. So, my aspiration will be determined by my people and after that, I will make my political decision known in a matter of days.”
It will be recalled that President Buhari encountered health challenge in 2017 which compelled him to proceed on medical vacation to London, the United Kingdom, on January 19, 2017.
The president returned to Nigeria on March 10, 2017, after 49 days medical holidays. On arrival, President Buhari admitted: “I have never been this sick in my life.”
The president missed three consecutive Federal Executive Council meetings. Buhari on May 7, 2017, returned to London for medical consultations and returned to the country on August 19, 2017.
