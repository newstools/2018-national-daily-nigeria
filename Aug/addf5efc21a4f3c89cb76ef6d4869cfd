Investigation by National Daily has revealed that the unveiling of Nigeria Air name and logo recently at the London Air-Show may be fading away over apparent lack of fund as the federal government suddenly become speechless on further build to the December inaugural flight.
National Daily gathered that there is no plan to order for either new or fairly used aircrafts and nothing has been heard on office accommodation, recruitment and even needed certifications to commence operations.
This is coming at a time the Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON) is still confused as to what to do with both Arik Air and Aero Contractors who are managing to stabilise.
National Daily also gathered that the supervising ministry is not finding it easy to access the initial $300m for Nigeria Air.  A credible source confided in our correspondent that the recent presidential vacation in London and cold feet of then Acting President Yemi Osinbajo frustrated requests for funding from government coffers.
Investigations also revealed that there is no application for an Air Operator’s Certificate (AOC) coming from Nigeria Air found at the Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA).
There are strong indications that government may have gone back to the drawing board to review initial plans which it has continued to hide from industry operators as no private sector operator made the list of steering committee but government officials even though the same handling government claimed that it will be private sector driven.
