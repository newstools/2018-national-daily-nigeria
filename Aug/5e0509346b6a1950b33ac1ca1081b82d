Uncertainties in the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) have continued to be on the rise, generating silent apprehension among certain party leaders and principal officers in the presidency. Party sources revealed that despite denials by the Presidency on the probability of President Buhari not contesting the 2019 presidential election, there are indications that there are pressures on the president to rethink contesting the presidential election in 2019. The sources also disclosed that President Buhari has been covertly grooming Alhaji Babagana Kingibe, to succeed him.
The national recognition and post-humous award to the family of M.K.O. Abiola in commemoration of the annulled June 12, 1993, presidential election was gathered to be part of the plans to re-activate Kingibe in partisan politics in the country. Kingibe was running mate to Abiola on the platform of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) that defeated Alhaji Bashir Tofa and Sylvester Ugo of the National republican convention in the June 12, 1993 presidential election annulled on June 23, 1993 by the military government.
The President was said to have showed immense passionate interests in the Kanuri which was said to be the origin of his mother.
Kingibe was identified as the alternative presidential candidate of the ruling APC if the incumbent president declines to contest in 2019.
There are innuendoes that the United Kingdom UK), the United States of America (USA) and Saudi Arabia have purportedly counseled the president against seeking second term
