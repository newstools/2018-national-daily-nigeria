The Economic and Financials Crimes Commission, EFCC, on Tuesday, released the Deputy President of the Senate, Barrister Ike Ekweremadu, on administrative bail after questioning him over alleged graft.

Ekweremadu had reported to the EFCC headquarters in Abuja on Tuesday morning but was released late in the evening.

The Deputy Senate President, a member of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), consistently maintains that his investigation by the EFCC is a witch-hunt after he was busted for owing several undeclared real estate investments overseas.

The EFCC previously sought court order to confiscate the said property the Deputy Senate President failed to declare before the Code of Conduct Bureau which the commission said spread across Nigeria and overseas.
