Super Eagles exited the Russia 2018 earlier than planned after a late Marcos Rojo screamer gave the La Albiecete men the ticket to progress in the round of 16 despite the Eagles brilliant performance in the qualifiers.
Things have now gathered momentum since several senior players head to their respective clubs for the season preparations after an unlucky outing.
A viral video of the National Team assistant coach Salisu Yusuf caught in a bribery web released by a controversial Ghanaian journalist.
Super Eagles coach Gernot Rohr has backed his assistant who was implicated in a sting operation by controversial Ghana journalist, who caught Yusuf on tape accepting bribe to fix a player in his team during the African Nations Championship in Morocco.
 
Rohr argued that Yusuf was just a victim of people who “just want to entrap” others.
 
“I saw the video, and I saw what happened,” Rohr revealed.
 
“From my experience, Salisu is an honest man.
 
“Those people just want to make trouble, this is people just trying to catch some people.
“Salisu does not need that money; he is a victim of this situation.”
 
Yusuf who is in the UK receiving medical attention will appear before a Nigeria Football Federation ethics committee to explain himself when he returns to Nigeria.
 
During the conversation, they handed the Nigerian coach N360, 000 ($1000) and alluded to more cash incentives if he selects their players for CHAN 2018 which held in Morocco.
 
The clip was published by BBC African Eye.
 
The meeting happened in Ghana during the 2017 WAFU Cup where Nigeria finished second after losing the final 4-1 to host Ghana.
