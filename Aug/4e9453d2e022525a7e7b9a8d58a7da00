Controversial Senator representing Kogi west, Dino Melaye, has alleged a clandestine plan by the police to kill him.
In a series of tweets by the flamboyant senator on Monday, Melaye said the police and Kogi government “want to forcefully take me to Lokoja and kill me afterwards”.
Recall that the senator’s relative recently raised an alarm that he was kidnapped on his way to a court in Kogi regarding one of the cases.
Melaye has been having a running battle with the police over several cases including culpable homicide, gun running and criminal conspiracy.
In the tweets, the senator described as ludicrous claims the purported kidnap was fabricated.
He wrote: “Nigerian police working with Kogi state government in trying to frame me up again with culpable homicide and illegal possession of fire arm.
“This is going to be the 6th arraignment of police against me. They want to forcefully take me to Lokoja and kill me afterwards. cc: UN, EU, USA, AU
“I was the one attacked by the police, they tried to kill me, AIT reporter and other journalists were there … To turn around and accuse harmless me of lies is rediculous.”
He added that those behind his ordeal will be “shocked because I know too much.”
