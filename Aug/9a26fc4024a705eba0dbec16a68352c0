Hon. Abdulmumin Jibrin from Kano state has said that at least four governors in the PDP are working with the APC ahead of the 2019 election.
The lawmaker said the governors have a “cross-party arrangement” with the APC–though he refused to mention their names.
According to him, the ruling party is “not shaking” despite losing many of its key members in the last one week.
The APC has lost 46 members of the National Assembly and three governors to the opposition since last week.
Jibrin, however, said efforts are going on to ensure the party’s “strongholds remain intact.”
“If the APC were presenting another candidate other than President Muhammadu Buhari, I would have been a bit jittery about the defections but there is this consensus within the party with Buhari as our presidential candidate,” he told journalists in Abuja.
“Those people against Buhari in Nigeria are just a group of elites with no electoral value. And so the next election is going to be between some sections of the elites verses the masses.”
