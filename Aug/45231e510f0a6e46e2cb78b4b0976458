Former FIFA vice-president Juan Angel Napout has been sentenced to nine years in prison after he was convicted of racketeering and corruption offences as part of the FIFA bribery scandal.
Napout, a former president of South America’s football governing body CONMEBOL, was sentenced in Brooklyn, New York, on Wednesday.
A statement from the office of US Attorney Richard Donoghue said Napout, convicted of conspiratorial racketeering and two counts of wire fraud conspiracy, will also have to pay $4.3million (£3.3m) in financial penalties.
“Napout’s conviction, as well as the successful prosecution of other high-level soccer officials, has struck at the core of corruption in soccer and underscores the need for continued vigilance against fraud and bribery in the sport,” said Donoghue.

Napout’s sentencing comes after former Brazilian Football Confederation president José Maria Marin was sentenced to four years in prison for racketeering and corruption offences earlier this month. Maria
Marin, 86, took bribes in exchange for the media and marketing rights to various tournaments, including the Copa America.
