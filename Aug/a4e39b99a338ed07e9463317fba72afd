Cristiano Ronaldo says it was “an easy decision” to swap life at Real Madrid for that at Juventus, with a €100 million (£89m/$114m) transfer allowing him to fulfil a childhood dream,National Daily gathered.
Having broken countless records over the course of nine years in the Spanish capital, the Portuguese superstar has opted to take on a new challenge this summer.
He is 33 years of age, but has shown no sign of slowing down as he chases down a sixth Ballon d’Or crown and another FIFA Best prize.
He told JuventusTV after linking up with his new team-mates for pre-season training: “Great club, first of all it is a great club. Since I was a kid, I looked at this team and said I hope to play there one day. Now I will play for a fantastic club, one of the biggest clubs in the world. I’m happy.
“I don’t have a precise moment when I decided. During the years, we played a few times against Juve and I had a special feeling that the Italian supporters like Cristiano.
“It’s the biggest club in Italy, one of the best in the world, so it was an easy decision, as Juve are an unbelievable club.”
