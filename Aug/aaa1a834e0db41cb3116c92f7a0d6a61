Luka Modric is determined to leave Real Madrid for Inter Milan so that he can prove himself in Serie A, according to the midfielder’s agent.
Inter have pursued an ambitious move for Modric for much of the summer, but have so far been able to persuade the La Liga giants to sell their star midfielder.
The Croatian, who helped his country reach the World Cup final in Moscow last month, remains keen on a move, although a free transfer when his contract expires in 2020 appears more likely with the Italian window closing this week.
Modric’s agent, Marko Naletilic, believes Cristiano Ronaldo’s £100million switch from the Bernabeu to Juventus has influenced his client – and he expects the 32-year-old to make a similar move in the future.
‘The fact Inter Milan tried to sign him and Modric took it into consideration shows the influence Cristiano Ronaldo is already having on Italian football,’ Naletilic told Italian newspaper Tuttosport.
‘For whatever reason, Modric wants to be a star in Serie A with Inter. Let’s see. I believe that sooner or later Luka will play in Italy.
‘Like a lot of Croatians his age, he grew up watching Italian football.’
Inter boss Luciano Spalletti admitted his interest in Modric last week – and claimed that the former Tottenham playmaker wanted to make the move to Milan.
‘The fact that he has interest in us is a great sign for our project,’ he told Sky Sport Italia.
‘It’s not easy to get these types of players. He may not come but our directors still did a great job, so let’s see.
‘I don’t think he will come, because Real Madrid still want to count on him. We’re a strong side. If Modric were to join us, we’d be very strong.’
