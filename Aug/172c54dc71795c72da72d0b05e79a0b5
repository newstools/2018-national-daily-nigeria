The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) regrets the leakages of the party’s notice of states congresses and primary election to elect candidates for the 2019 general elections which was communicated to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).
APC Acting National Publicity Secretary, Yekini Nabena, in a statement in Abuja, admonished the INEC Chairman, Professor Mahmood Yakubu, on the imperative of confidential internal handling of official correspondence to the Commission. The party protested the leakage of its notice to the Commission on the schedules to elect candidates for 2019 elections.
The statement read: “Our attention has been drawn to a leaked letter the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, wrote to the Chairman, Independent National Electoral Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, informing the Commission of the schedule of the Congresses and Primaries to elect Party candidates for the 2019 General Elections.
“These leaks of our sensitive and confidential correspondence to INEC is becoming commonplace and totally unacceptable.
“We strongly request that INEC looks into its internal handling of official correspondence and put a stop to these leaks.
“While the leaked formal notification to INEC has been done by the APC pursuant to the provisions of Section 85 of the 2010 Electoral Act (as amended), we advise the general public particularly the media to wait for an official announcement from the Party as the leaked dates are subject to changes, if necessary.”
