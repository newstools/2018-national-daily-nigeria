Real Madrid are said to be monitoring the situation at PSG very closely with a late summer move for Kylian Mbappe still on the cards,National Daily learnt.
Mbappe joined PSG from Monaco on August 31 last year in a loan deal that was due to be made permanent this summer. PSG opted for an initial loan move in order to defer payment of his £163million transfer fee until this summer to help them comply with UEFA Financial Fair Play regulations after spending £198m on Neymar.
But according to AS, PSG are facing possible FFP sanctions which could prevent them from making Mbappe’s move from Monaco permanent. AS claim that UEFA must resolve their investigation into PSG’s finances by August 30 — the day before the transfer window closes.
The suggestion is that if UEFA hit PSG with a transfer ban as part of their possible punishment, Mbappe could be returned to  Monaco, giving Real 24 hours to swoop.
Were PSG to lose Mbappe it would be a devastating blow after the 19-year-old cemented his status as one of the best players on the planet with multiple fine performances in France’s victorious World Cup campaign.
His four goals at Russia 2018 came after he netted 13 and provided eight assists in 27 Ligue 1 outings in his debut season in Paris.
He started the new season in fine form too, coming off the bench to score twice in last weekend’s 3-1 win over Guingamp.
