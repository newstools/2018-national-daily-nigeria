Sokoto’s Deputy Governor Ahmed Aliyu has vowed to stay back in the APC despite the sudden flight of his boss Aminu Tambuwal elected on the platform of the party he recently dumped.
Ihough 18 members of state assembly also joined him, Senator Ibrahim Gobir, seven House of Representatives members, 12 other members of the state House of Assembly and many others decide to remain in the APC.
Chairman of the Northern Senators Forum and past governor of Sokoto Senator Aliyu ‎Wamakko has dismissed Tambuwal’s move.
He insisted Sokoto state remains an APC state.
Wamakko also restated the state’s support for Buhari, saying, “We’re solidly behind President Muhammadu Buhari.”
”The people of the state are also solidly behind me, other senator, other House of Representatives members and elders who have chosen to remain in the APC.
”Whatever crowd you might have seen or been told about, just take it as a mere story. Sokoto remains an APC state,” he said.
He said he pitied Tambuwal who he described as a very promising young politician, full of potentials.
”Maybe, something else is guiding his decision. This is the worst decision he has taken in his life.
”At his age, he should not be in a hurry. He is a fine young politician. I have a lot of respect for him.
“If he had taken into consideration the people he is representing, the people of Sokoto State, he should not have gone into the PDP,” Wamakko said.
Inside sources revealed that the PDP governors forum have dangled the party’s presidential ticket before him, promising him they have his back.
