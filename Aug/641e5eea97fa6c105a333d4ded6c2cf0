The Lagos state government has announced that the third mainland bridge which was temporarily closed for investigative maintenance test would be reopened by 5pm on Sunday.
Taiwo Salaam, Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Transportation, said the decision to reopen the bridge earlier than announced followed the completion of the test by engineers.
The government also thanked motorists and residents for their cooperation and patience while the closure lasted.
The state government, in partnership with the federal government, had temporarily shut the bridge for the investigative maintenance test with the closure initially scheduled to last from midnight of last Thursday to midnight of Sunday.
The closure of the bridge which connects the mainland part of Lagos to the Island, had led to gridlock in different parts of the state while operators of commercial vehicles hiked fares.
Olawale Musa, general manager of the Lagos State Traffic Management Authority (LASTMA), had advised motorists without urgent need to move in and out of the Island to avoid the alternative routes in view of the closure of the bridge.
