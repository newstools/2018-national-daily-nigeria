After condemning the Tuesday invasion of the National Assembly by the DSS, the APC has now turned around to support the DSS, saying it the siege was meant to maintain order.
The party’s initial reaction was to warn critics not to blame the ruling party for the siege, insisting it was “strictly a legislative matter.”
The APC later joined other individuals, groups and even foreign diplomatic missions to condemn the attack, describing the security agencies’ action as an “unfortunate invasion”.
It also dissociated itself from “any act of brigandage and affront on the sacred symbols of our budding democracy.”
The siege lasted till afternoon when SSS operatives stood down after receiving reports that Acting President Yemi Osinbajo did not authorise the deployment and had fired the director-general of the secret police, Lawal Daura.
However, there was a twist Wednesday morning when another statement was released by the party, which indicated Osinbajo fired Daura in error.
According to the document, Senate President Bukola Saraki was orchestrated the plot, and that security agencies only moved in to prevent any outbreak of violence.
Since the party has spoken from the other side of the mouth, Osinbajo may now be force to recall the DSS boss he sacked.
