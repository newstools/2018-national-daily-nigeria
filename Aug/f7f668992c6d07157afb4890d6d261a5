The 26 year old who plays for Vasa Akademia in the Hungarian league said their mission in Lagos is to finish the second phase on a high note in time for World Cup in Spain.
“I expect everybody to have a solid focus. We are ready to finish the second part of camp and get a solid defense going. I expect that everybody will come in and stay focused because the second phase of the camp is the most important.”
According to the former co-captain of the team, going by the statistics of the friendlies played during the first phase of their camping in Atlanta, the team’s offense has been great.
National Daily gathered that the 26 year old who played a pivotal role in D’Tigress’ emergence as African Champions in 2017 while speaking on arrival in Lagos said putting on the National team’s jersey and representing millions of Nigerians comes with a bit of pressure on any player which for her is normal.
Despite the recent appointment of Adaora Elonu as captain, Ezinne said she will continue to play her leadership role on the court and give her best to bring glory to Nigeria anytime she steps on the court.
“As a point guard, I have to be a leader on the floor, talk my team mates through and communicate”, she concluded.
