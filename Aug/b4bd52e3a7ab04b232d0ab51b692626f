It keeps pouring on the PDP as no fewer than four senators have dumped the opposition, though their defections are yet to be declared on the floor of the Senate.
Three of them left the PDP for the APC, and one for the All Progressives Grand Alliance.
Among them are Senators Hope Uzodinma (Imo State) and Fatimah Raji-Rasaki (Ekiti State), formerly of the PDP.
Both have been identifying with the APC within and outside the Senate.
Senator Sonny Ogbuoji (Ebonyi State) has also introduced himself as the “the newest catch” of the APC when the National Working Committee of the party met with the Senate caucus.
The APGA latest catch is Anambra’s Sen. Stella Oduah.
Majorirty leader Ahmed Lawan had hinted there were senators ready to move into the ruling party during the mass defection of 14 senators to the opposition.
Lawan had said the public appearance of Uzodinma and Raji-Rasaki with the APC caucus members had answered the question.
Uzodinma himself claimed he had written to the Senate President to declare his defection on the floor but his letter was not read.
“I am a bona fide, registered, financial card-carrying member of the APC. As you are aware, two months ago, I wrote to the leadership of the Senate. The duty to read it is not mine,” he said.
Raji-Rasaki also said she made it open and public to all Nigerians that I’ve moved from the PDP to the APC both at the ward level and on the floor.
Sen. Godswill  Akpabio, minority leader, was the first to jump ship from the opposition last Wednesday.
