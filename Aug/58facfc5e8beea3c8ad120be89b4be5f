Real Madrid are reportedly looking to push ahead of Barcelona in the battle to sign Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Adrien Rabiot.
The 23-year-old is a player in demand as his current contract will expire next summer, at which point he will be available on a free and so perhaps PSG would be well advised to sell while they can.
Despite his relatively young age, Rabiot has already logged 208 appearances for the Ligue 1 giants, while winning four league titles and a whole host of other domestic trophies.
Coupled with his technical quality and class on the ball, he’d be a great fit for the Spanish game, and with that in mind Don Balon claim that Real Madrid are looking to pounce ahead of Barcelona for the €50m midfield ace with just over a week to go until the transfer window closes in Spain.
It remains to be seen whether or not they’re successful there are a number of top European clubs reportedly monitoring Rabiot’s situation. The Sun claim that Liverpool were keen, while AC Milan, Inter and Juventus are all linked by Calciomercato.
With that in mind, competition will be fierce if Real Madrid are indeed interested in landing the French international to further bolster what is already a strong midfield at Julen Lopetegui’s disposal.
Nevertheless, given he is still only 23, Rabiot could certainly be considered a long-term pillar at the Bernabeu if he were to move to the Spanish capital, with Luka Modric in particular on the wrong side of 30 perhaps making way alongside the likes of Toni Kroos and Casemiro.
