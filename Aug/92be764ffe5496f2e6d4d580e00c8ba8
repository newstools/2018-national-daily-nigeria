AC Milan’s extended absence from title contention has not impacted the club’s standing among players, according to Gennaro Gattuso,National Daily gathered.
Gennaro Gattuso believes the signings of Gonzalo Higuain and Mattia Caldara show AC Milan have lost none of their prestige. The Rossoneri, sixth in Serie A last season, acquired the pair from Juventus on Thursday as part of a deal that included Leonardo Bonucci returning to his former club.
The latter’s desire to leave after just one year was viewed as an indictment of a malaise thathas seen Milan fail to achieve a top-four finish since 2012-13. Gattuso, though, believes the addition of two internationals reflects positively on his club’s stature.
Milan were believed to be interested in the 31-year-old, but Gattuso explained financial restraints meant any deal was impossible.
“Who doesn’t like Arturo Vidal? We all know the kind of player that he is. I remember when I played against him he was a warrior,” the former Italy midfielder said.
“He was someone that not only gave you quality but he also gave you quantity. He’s a great player. He knows football, again he’s got great quality and that’s probably the reason why Barcelona got him.
“As far as we are concerned, we come from a very difficult time in our club. A time of problems with Financial Fair Play, and for that reason we really wouldn’t have been able to afford to being him here.”
