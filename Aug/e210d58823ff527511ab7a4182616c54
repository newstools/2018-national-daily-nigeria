Buruj Sports Academy have successfully defended their English Super Cup title and added a gloss to it by wining the youth title of the 2018 English Super Cup in far away Manchester, the United Kingdom recently, National Daily learnt.
The Nigerian representatives made good their promise to fly higher than last edition  as they thrashed Baloan FC of Scotland 8-1 in the Youth Category final game while they also surmounted all odds to defeat Lostock Rangers 5-4 through penalty shootouts in the Men’s Category after the pulsating final game ended 1-1 in regulation time.
The CEO of Buruj Sports Academy, Salaudeen Waheed was full of thanks for making the feat possible, just as he also expressed gratitude to some highly distinguished individuals who supported his management to make the trip a reality despite some tough challenges they encountered in the course of preparation.
He expressed optimism that with the kind of performance delivered throughout the tournament organised by Team Tours Direct, many of them will get the nod of international scouts for trials both in the United Kingdom and other parts of Europe.
“It was a great feat from our boys as we emerged as champions both in the youth category and men’s category of this year’s edition of English Super Cup. We came to the United Kingdom to defend our title from last year but we ended up with two trophies which called for celebrations.”
“I thank my players for making me and all our supporters happy. We are grateful to those who contributed in some special ways both in kind  and cash to make this dream come through Waheed told National Daily.
