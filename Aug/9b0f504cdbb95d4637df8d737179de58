Barcelona director Guillermo Amor has suggested that the club haven’t given up on signing Paul Pogba,National Daily gathered.
The World Cup winner has hit the headlines throughout the summer due to his apparently strained relationship with manager Jose Mourinho, despite being named captain for the Red Devils’ opening league match of the season – a 2-1 victory over Leicester.
When asked specifically about Pogba following the 3-0 win over Alaves he told reporters: “We have a good squad now in order to face our objectives, we don’t know what will happen but we have a strong squad.
“The debutants have been positive, they have performed to their ability, they are good footballers.
National Daily learnt “Alaves worked a lot, maybe more defensively and they were well positioned. They didn’t want to score and that the minutes went by and it needed to be Leo with a set-play to get the breakthrough.”
