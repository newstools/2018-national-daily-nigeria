A mammoth crowd of people from all walks of life gathered to give their last respect to late Mrs. Bose Omokide (Nee Ilupeju), the virtuous and down-to-earth wife of Afemai-born renowned chartered accountant, Mr. Kamilu Omokide, from Igarra, the headquarters of Akoko-Edo Local Government Area, Edo State, Nigeria, who passed on recently few days after her birthday.
National Daily was at the burial event to observe the proceedings. The event was well attended by relatives, friends, close associates and well-wishers from Nigeria and in diaspora.
Among those that graced the event was Hon. Desmond Elliot. National Daily spoke with him and he told us how closely his wife and the late Aunty Bose was. He also expressed how he had come to know her from the church they both attended.
Accolades and encomium about the person and rich personality of the deceased rented the air thereby giving credit to the popular credence that, “Life is not in attaining Methuselah’s age, but in living footprints on the sand of life.”
Bose Omokide’s life and times:
Bosede Omokide, a daughter of the late Juliana and Jacob Ilupeju of Ejigbo, Osun State was born on Sunday, July 25, 1971, in Jos city, the Plateau State capital. She grew up a happy girl in the cold city of Jos at the height of its tin mining fame. Bose had her primary and secondary education in Jos after which she proceeded to the University of Jos where she had a Diploma in Banking and Finance. After a brief time at Little Lambs School, Jos, she returned to the University of Jos where she secured a Bachelors of Education (Economics). At an early age, she professed her faith in Jesus Christ and joined El- Shaddai Covenant Church in Jos where she was a devoted member. She worked as a sales officer at the church’s bookshop and dutifully discharged her duties. The husband would often refer to the bookshop as the first place he noticed the damsel. She had a smile, she knew the books, the tapes and was always persuading members to buy something. At El- Shaddai Covenant Church, she served with joy in the youth choir and later in the mass choir. She also served in other capacities like the decoration team, the church women’s fellowship, etc and was later ordained a pastor. She had a great passion for hospital visitation and prayed keenly for the sick and children.
She was united in holy matrimony to Mr. Kamilu Alaba Omokide on June 5, 1999, in Jos. This union was blessed with five lovely children and her adopted daughter, she was a lover. She broke boundaries to accept the love of a young man from Edo State. A great lover, she enjoyed the trust and confidence of her husband. Indeed she died on a mission of love. She gave all.
Bosede Omokide having established La’sharone, a fashion business that had earned her a name in her career, undertook Entrepreneurial Development training at the prestigious Lagos Business School to enhance her management skills. Apart from working hard to see her business grow, she genuinely enjoyed dressing her customers up. She participated in her first fashion show in May 2018 displaying Nigerian made children’s clothing designs. She had the dream of producing for export and creating a Nigerian version of ‘Senegalese clothing Centre’ in Lagos.
Pastor (Mrs) Bosede Omokide was an active member of the Daughters of Destiny (DOD) where she also served as a member of the worship team. As a result of her generous spirit and pleasant personality, she was loved by many. Her Christian life was as beautiful as the flowers she loved so well, and her influence will forever remain in the lives of all who knew her.
Just before the unfortunate and unexpected circumstances that led to the death of Pastor (Mrs.) Bosede Omokide occurred on August 1, 2108, she had commenced work on the production of a gospel music album with a view to reaching the world with her God-given talent as a singer.
Her beautiful life and times will forever be cherished in the lives of her husband, Mr. Kamilu Alaba Omokide; her children: Hephzibah, Jedidiah, Sharon, Golda, Michelle, Favour (an adopted daughter), and her numerous spiritual children; her devoted family: brothers and sisters, nieces and nephews, cousins; her devoted in-laws: parents- in- law, brothers and sisters-in-law; a host of devoted friends and the church in general.
Bose lived and died a Christian. She loved God dearly. She lived for the promise of eternal life. We close with the confidence that she is in the bosom of the Lord.
Farewell Pastor (Mrs.) Bosede Omokide!!!
Tributes From Family and Friends:
A few weeks ago, it was your birthday, and we were all smiles but deferred the celebrations. Then it was going to be my birthday in August and we agreed to celebrate in a special way with the children. Alas, it was not to be! Today, I stand here gazing at your body, bearing the pains of your sudden and unplanned exit. You did not choose this path, fate brought it on you. As I surrender to the will of God, I testify that you loved me absolutely; you loved and worshipped God wholly; you cared for our children dearly. You were kind, cheerful and caring. It is also sad to lose your physical presence, but I trust God and His word that you have a good place in Heaven. I will love you forever. I will celebrate the gift God permitted me to have. I will forever be thankful to God for granting me the privilege to be your husband. Thank you for being such a devoted and loving wife to me and a wonderful mother to our children. Adieu, my love, we will meet again.
Kamilu Omokide- Husband
Dear mother, you were a wonderful mother, a sweet mother, and a nice mother. You helped me with things like my handwriting, spellings, and during my exams, you told me to not do some things like watching television. You worked hard to make me a good girl. Mother, I really love you, you have done a lot for me, I will never forget you! But I miss you and would keep missing you.
Golda Omokide- Daughter
Dear mum, you are one of a kind, unique and peculiar. I don’t know how it all happened but to be sincere, I still don’t believe. It feels like a dream but even with that, you showered me with your love, pushed me forward to work hard, advised me with your words and played with me like your best friend, you are one in a million, mum. Thank you, mummy, for the wonderful mummy you are.
Michele Omokide-Daughter
My wonderful, beautiful mother of the family. Mum, I love you so much. You have been a mother to me and to all. I appreciate you for the care, the effort, the teaching, the scolding, and the laughter you brought to my heart. I still remember every moment we had; how you usually put smiles on our faces. I remember our’ talk of life’ session. My siblings and I usually tease you on how a supposed five minutes session usually exceed one hour! It was usually interesting! Though we thought it boring sometimes, but all the same, we enjoyed the fun and the seriousness you always bring into it. Now, we would never have those inspiring sessions with you again. Oh, mum! How we miss you! You were always pushing, encouraging, helping, teaching, with patience and a deep sense of responsibility. I always loved your total devotion to your work and to our success. You were a woman of honor, respect, love, honesty, compassion and many more. We promise to make you proud and finish what you could not complete. Though I still hurt deeply, but it’s comforting to know you’re in God’s loving embrace. Farewell, the best mum ever.
Hephzibah Omokide- Daughter
Dear mum, I always thought I would share loving memories of every stage of my growing up with you. Now, God says it’s not to be. I am still short of words! All I can say is that you are the best mother anyone can wish for. You did not only raise me gallantly, you raised my siblings so well that we all can stand anywhere and be proud to be called your children. You were a very strong and selfless woman and your angelic voice is something I could still hear and will always want to hear. How I would have given anything to hear it one last time! Mum, your death has left a very big void in my heart; I may never understand why you had to leave so soon, but God knows best. Rest in peace Great Mum, I will always love you.
Jedidiah- son
Dear Mum, you’re one of a kind, unique and peculiar, I still can’t believe you are gone. It feels like a dream! You showered me with so much so much love, pushed me with your hands and advised me like a good mother should, and also played with me like a friend. On January 7th I was born, on January 7th I knew you, on January 7th I knew an angel, January 7th I had a mother, a very special one. I know you are not dead but sleeping. Mummy, I love you, may your soul rest in perfect peace. Sleep on, till we meet again.
Sharon- Daughter
How can I begin to describe the most selfless person I know? How can I explain the ways she made me a better person by her acts of kindness? Can I recount enough how she never missed an opportunity to encourage me? What about the dozens of lives she touched? To call her a ‘giver’ does no adequate justice. Bose, you gave your love, your time, your substance, your passion, your smile, your voice. You gave all! That was simply your nature. Together we talked, we laughed, we cried, we prayed, we danced, we sang… As painful as this is, as heartbroken as I am, I take solace in the assurance that you are now in a better place. You were a treasure, my friend. As you join the heavenly choir to sing “Glory to God in the highest…” I say goodnight my darling. Till we meet to depart no more.
Bukola Olufemi- bosom friend
My Dear Aunty B, as we fondly called you. I wished I reached out more, I wished I had visited you more. I took for granted that you would always be a call away, I took for granted that you knew how much we ( My Husband and I) loved you. Sadly, in your absence, I am lying down here typing a tribute to you. I remember how you took me by the hand and walked me through the whole of Balogun market in preparation for our wedding, you spared nothing; not your time, wisdom, or even resources to ensure I had the wedding of my dreams. Oh, Aunty B! I remember how you’d call me to encourage my Husband to do something with his voice, I remember how you’d always admonish me to pray tirelessly for my husband! Oh, death! Where is thy sting? I attest to the fact that you were truly an all-rounder, a dutiful wife, and mother, a fervent worshipper of God, a lover of Christ and people. Indeed, you had a heart large enough for ALL. Although, we mourn your loss, but I am encouraged by the quality of the life you lived. Indeed, you fought a ‘good fight of faith’. You will live forever in my heart. Rest sweetly in the boom of the Almighty until the resurrection morning when we shall meet to part no more. Fare thee well my dearest Aunty B!
Meyi Razak Omokide- sister-in-law
Bose, your profound impact, and responsibilities in the family are unquantifiable. You were benevolent, caring kind and loving to all who came across you. As a daughter-in-law to our parents, you exhibited the best of qualities. Missing you as a person makes the whole world seem depopulated! Adieu, Bose!-Bar. Idow Omokide- Daniyan- sister-in-law
Although our hearts may be broken; we know you are in a wonderful place now, where you are happy and carefree. It was God’s time for you to go, and you have left behind good memories to comfort us…one day, we’ll be together again. We shall try to lift up our heads no, and dare to set grief aside, because we shall be remembering you from here, to always hold your memories in the palms of our hands. Sleep well, dear Aunty, sleep well.
Mr. & Mrs. Olubamidele Elempe-in-laws
It’s sad, yet an honor to pay a tribute to a very special and irreplaceable person in my life- my beloved sister-in-law. I have struggled with what to say, and where to start. There are so many beautiful things to say about Aunty B, as I fondly called her. How would I explain the kindness in her heart, the infectious joy and the depth of her love? How could I be able, to sum up, her beautiful life writing? In all, she meant a lot to us all. Aunty B, your memory is a keepsake from which I’ll never part. Good has you in His arms, but I have you in my heart always. Sleep on, till we meet to part no more.
Munirat Omokide-sister-in-law
A heart so beautiful inside and out…heaven just received a gem. You will be sorely missed…
Ozavize Ogunmefun- sister-in-law
Alight from our family has gone out! A voice we loved and cherished is now still. I wish God could have spared you if just for a few more years. Osi- Kamilu (as fondly called, we hold you close within our hearts and there you remain for all of us, whom you gave your best. Now the time has come for you to rest. So, go in peace, for you have earned your sleep. Your vacant place no one can fill. We miss you now and always will.
Rali- sister-in-law
How much of a tribute can we really pay for such an enigma of a woman that would be adequate and satisfying? A woman of integrity. She was hardworking, always smiling, a cheerful woman whom we will never forget. She always contributed to the progress of the family. A dependable ally and a unifier, a rare gem, and a loving sister. In fact, we are yet to come to terms with the reality of your transition to eternal glory. My solace is that you lived a worthy and fulfilled life. My sister, Bose, Osi Kamilu, we thank you for being there for us all while your life lasted. Despite your departure from this sinful world, we will continue to cherish your loving memories. Rest in the bosom of our Lord Jesus Christ. Shalom!
Mrs. H.T.Aliu & children
Aunty B( as I fondly called you) how can I possibly sum up all that you represented in your time. Is it the kindness in your heart, the contagiousness of the joy you exuded, the genuineness of your intentions, or even the depth of the of your love? You were simply remarkable by every standard. You were not only beautiful on the outside, but also a beautiful soul who always saw the beauty in others. You added color to our family. You included us in your life with your presence, your love, your support and your encouragements. You gave so much, loved so much and now you have left a vacuum too much to fill. Words cannot describe how much she will be missed. However, I surrender to the superior will of God trusting that His will is good and His timings perfect. You’ll live forever in our hearts. Aunty B thank you so much for being such a blessing to our family and a special sister and friend to me. I will miss you, but I am eternally grateful to God that our paths crossed in your lifetime. Farewell Aunty B! Continue to rest in peace until we meet at the Lord’s feet.
Razak Omokide -Brother-in-law
You left like a candle in the wind, clothing us in grief and mourning, leaving a gap that will forever remain too big to be filled. You were the strength of the household of Omokide, the pillar that we all lean on, the “everybody’s” confidant, the secret of our unity, our quiet influencer, untiring encourager, our faultless peacemaker. I mourn, not because I have lost hope, but because I long for one more conversation with you. Well, I rest in hope that you are in a better place. Blessed are the peacemakers, for they are the sons of God. Go well, thou daughter of the Most High. We will love you forever.
Wakilu Omokide- Brother-in-law)
Aunty Bose, a woman with a golden heart!” charm is deceptive, and beauty does not last; but a woman who fears the Lord will be greatly praised. You were indeed a woman after God’s heart. You died for love and passion you had for your immediate family and that of the Omokide’s. You showed us love irrespective of your tribe and ethnicity. You were not just a wife, but a woman of virtue, a woman we could call our own. In deep tears, I remember when you called me to pray for my sick husband from the UK, just a few days before his demise. I was surrounded after the funeral of my late husband when the news of your death came to me on your way to mourn with me (your little sister-in-law). Oh! It was indeed a double tragedy! Your passion for love will sustain your home, God will comfort your husband and your children till we meet again.
Evans- Egure Memunat (Nee Omokide)- sister-in-law
Dear Aunt, I still want to ask why you didn’t stay alive to see what I will become. Your words of advice have reformed my life profitably. Indeed, you are more like a mother to me! You were always there when I needed you; a blessing to my life. Know that your absence has created a big vacuum in our hearts and has brought endless tears to our eyes, but I know you’ll always want us to be happy. I love you so much and I know you are resting in the bosom of the lord. Rest in peace, my beloved Aunt.
Oluwatobi- Nephew
Your life was a blessing, your memory, a treasure. You are loved beyond words and missed beyond measure. Till we meet again. Farewell our dear wife/sister, Aunty B.
Efisue & Latty Gomina- in-laws
Sweet mother. You were exceptionally intelligent, unique and beautiful. You were beautiful both in and out. So kind and gentle. You always had my back. I feel so fortunate to have known and learned from you because you are special and loved by all; I will always remember your sweet smile. A fighter, a goal getter, my mother, and teacher. Losing you at such a time scares my soul because you made me who I am today. I will love you now and forever, I will miss you dearly, Goodbye Mum till we meet to part no more.
Favor Akpan-Daughter (Adopted)
You have always cared for me like my Mom will do. I wished I was more outspoken when you were around. We rehearsed songs; always pushing everyone to bring out his or her hidden talent. We know you are resting by his grace we shall meet again in heaven.
Onavi- Cousin (in-law)
Bosede, your demise is not a loss, but again so says the word of God. Your absence left a vacuum in our hearts which only God can fill. We shall miss you greatly, however, we rest in the fact that we shall meet again on resurrection morning. Adieu, my lovely sister.
Akin Ilupeju- Brother
My loving sister, I am proud and happy that I had someone like you for a sister. You were a gift to us and especially to me. Every moment spent with you was a special memory and I can never forget you in my life. It’s not fair as you left me like this with all the plans we had together. You never said it was going to be this soon. You were always there for me. I find it difficult to believe you are gone, however, I will never forget you, I will always miss you, dear sister. Rest in the Bosom of the Lord, because I know you made it to heaven. I love you so much…my twin.
Bola Ilupeju
My cousin! My sister! My Mum’s carbon copy!!! Aunty Bose!!!! A woman of faith, very industrious, hardworking and an epitome of a woman of visions and dreams. We talked about everything and anything. You always provided a listening ear and always had a word of advice to share. I screamed and wailed at the news of your demise and I have not ceased to ask questions. My heart sinks at the thought that I may not see you anymore in this life. I am yet to accept this fate. Now, I bless God that Mum has gone to rest before this day. Abosede, your sudden departure has left a deep hole in our hearts. I can only pray that the Lord strengthen the loved ones you left behind. You walked with the Lord- I am therefore certain that the Lord will preserve and keep your children.
Joke Opaniran(cousin) and family.
It is hard to put into words how I felt about your sudden departure, Aunty Bose! The natural emotions of loss and nostalgia poured over me. A strange sense of frustration as I try to bring to mind your facial expression, your voice and most of all your personality. You were full of ideas, hardworking and served God all your life. It is so unfair to lose you now- no! I don’t have answers as to why you have to leave your beloved ones now. I remember the last time I saw you in London, two weeks before the sad news f your departure. I gave you a birthday wish a week before your death. It is difficult to accept you are gone. Farewell, Aunty Bose! Farewell!! We love you but God loves you more. Rest on. –
Olaitan Leigh and family (cousin).
“And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, ‘write’. Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: yea, saith the spirit, that they may rest from their labors; and their works do follow them”. Sister Bose…our dearest sister, our friend, our confidant, our counselor. Writing this hit us badly, really, really badly. Our hearts are in pains: how can we be writing this for you, Mama B!! How?? Without a goodbye? Just like that? You had big dreams, big plans…our hearts have broken into a million pieces; this nightmare has refused to go away. We still can’t believe we will not see your smiling face again, we will not hear your voice again. Just three ago, we had an amazing family time together. We talked about so many things, you had so many plans, amazing plans we dropped you off at the airport with hugs and goodbyes. You were so full of life and energy, as usual, all smiles and then we get this devastating news speechless…but God knows best. We are grateful for the time we had together. They are memories we will cherish forever and forever. The children are heartbroken, they are constantly asking us questions, but we have no answers. Nevertheless, God knows. He knows and sees what we don’t. Rest well our darling sister, till resurrection morning. It will never be the same without you, but it is well with our souls.
– Oris & Emmanuel Aidenojie- bosom friends
I still cannot believe you are gone! Oh, how I wish I could turn back the hands of time; how I wish, I hugged you more deeply and told you I loved you over and over again. As I remember that unfaithful day of your demise, it is still unbelievable to have sat by your side and suddenly, in a twinkle of an eye, death snatched you away from us. How can I come to terms with the fact that I will never hear your voice calling me ‘Mary Mary’ again; that I will never see you again and take our usual pictures ehnn…! You were a wonderful mother, a great wife, a wonderful friend and sister, an industrious entrepreneur, and more especially a lover of God and the things of God. You took on so much with a smile, oh that smile, oh that smile that could melt heart away. Aunties B are you truly gone? The assurance we have is that you have gone to be with the Lord singing with the angels and smiling down on us. Well, you are now resting in the bosom of the Lord. We take solace in the word of God: “our brothers and sisters, we want you to know the truth about those who have died so that you will not be sad, as are those who have no hope. We believe that Jesus died and rose again, and so we believe that God will take back with Jesus those who have died believing in hi”. Thank you, Aunty B, for loving us so much, for touching our lives in so many special ways and for truly leading by example. You will be greatly missed.
Mary Omokide (sister-in-law)
Some 20 years ago, my brother introduced us to this wonderful woman, Mrs. Bose Omokide (Nee Ilupeju). They have been married these years, blessed with godly children, lived a beautiful and exemplary life filled with great memories. Today, we pay this tribute in her honor. Sis. B as we fondly call her is the embodiment of the virtuous woman of Proverbs 31- never weary in doing good, her hands in the industry and her faith ever strong ministering to the needs of all and sundry.
We remember her today as a virtuous mother to her children and several other children around her. She made friends with and earned the confidence of her children, teaching them the faith in Christ Jesus. This we have seen demonstrated these few days as they took in the shocking news f her sudden departure.
We remember her as the chief mobilizing officer of the women in the family. She will call and challenge our wives to wake up and stand in the gap in the place of prayer for us the men and then the whole family. She has always believed that prayers were the weapon we have in God to overcome the evil of this world and realize our true potentials in life.
We’ll surely miss her hospitality. I can’t remember any time during these years she did not have guests in her home. Her kitchen ever busy. We know that we are guaranteed the real pounded yam whenever we visit. This is who Sis. B is!
She has an incurable love for worship. The first love that saw her return to the studios to express her love for God in worship. I had the privilege of listening to one of her practice sessions recently and still have that scenes fresh in my mind as she passionately sang the hymn” Abide with me, fast falls the eventide…”
We remember her as a bridge builder in the family. Facilitating and working for peace in all ways and at all times. We particularly will miss the love and care she has shown our parents, their attire at special family events and occasions. She has been the personal dresser for our aged Dad. We sure will miss this peacemaker.
Her hands were never idle. Active in the industry, always finding the next opportunity to pour her energy and passion. This trait has seen her establish La’ Sharone and birth other businesses in s short a time. She raced against time to express herself in industry, as if trying to ensure that she pours out her all, leaving no abilities unused.
Again, I can’t but speak of your faith. You never left anyone in doubt about your firm belief and faith in God, Jesus Christ, and His resurrection. Worship, passionate worship was your thing and we know that you have joined the saints above in adoration of our Heavenly Father. You have rested from your labors until the sound of the triumph of God! Sleep on dear Sis. B, till we meet at the feet of the Lord!

Dear mum, I always thought I would share loving memories of every stage of my growing up with you. Now, God says it’s not to be. I am still short of words! All I can say is that you are the best mother anyone can wish for. You did not only raise me gallantly, you raised my siblings so well that we all can stand anywhere and be proud to be called your children. You were a very strong and selfless woman and your angelic voice is something I could still hear and will always want to hear. How I would have given anything to hear it one last time! Mum, your death has left a very big void in my heart; I may never understand why you had to leave so soon, but God knows best. Rest in peace Great Mum, I will always love you.
Jedidiah- son
Dear Mum, you’re one of a kind, unique and peculiar, I still can’t believe you are gone. It feels like a dream! You showered me with so much so much love, pushed me with your hands and advised me like a good mother should, and also played with me like a friend. On January 7th I was born, on January 7th I knew you, on January 7th I knew an angel, January 7th I had a mother, a very special one. I know you are not dead but sleeping. Mummy, I love you, may your soul rest in perfect peace. Sleep on, till we meet again.
Sharon- Daughter
How can I begin to describe the most selfless person I know? How can I explain the ways she made me a better person by her acts of kindness? Can I recount enough how she never missed an opportunity to encourage me? What about the dozens of lives she touched? To call her a ‘giver’ does no adequate justice. Bose, you gave your love, your time, your substance, your passion, your smile, your voice. You gave all! That was simply your nature. Together we talked, we laughed, we cried, we prayed, we danced, we sang… As painful as this is, as heartbroken as I am, I take solace in the assurance that you are now in a better place. You were a treasure, my friend. As you join the heavenly choir to sing “Glory to God in the highest…” I say goodnight my darling. Till we meet to depart no more.
Bukola Olufemi- bosom friend
My Dear Aunty B, as we fondly called you. I wished I reached out more, I wished I had visited you more. I took for granted that you would always be a call away, I took for granted that you knew how much we ( My Husband and I) loved you. Sadly, in your absence, I am lying down here typing a tribute to you. I remember how you took me by the hand and walked me through the whole of Balogun market in preparation for our wedding, you spared nothing; not your time, wisdom, or even resources to ensure I had the wedding of my dreams. Oh, Aunty B! I remember how you’d call me to encourage my Husband to do something with his voice, I remember how you’d always admonish me to pray tirelessly for my husband! Oh, death! Where is thy sting? I attest to the fact that you were truly an all-rounder, a dutiful wife, and mother, a fervent worshipper of God, a lover of Christ and people. Indeed, you had a heart large enough for ALL. Although, we mourn your loss, but I am encouraged by the quality of the life you lived. Indeed, you fought a ‘good fight of faith’. You will live forever in my heart. Rest sweetly in the boom of the Almighty until the resurrection morning when we shall meet to part no more. Fare thee well my dearest Aunty B!
Meyi Razak Omokide- sister-in-law
Bose, your profound impact, and responsibilities in the family are unquantifiable. You were benevolent, caring kind and loving to all who came across you. As a daughter-in-law to our parents, you exhibited the best of qualities. Missing you as a person makes the whole world seem depopulated! Adieu, Bose!-Bar. Idow Omokide- Daniyan- sister-in-law
Although our hearts may be broken; we know you are in a wonderful place now, where you are happy and carefree. It was God’s time for you to go, and you have left behind good memories to comfort us…one day, we’ll be together again. We shall try to lift up our heads no, and dare to set grief aside, because we shall be remembering you from here, to always hold your memories in the palms of our hands. Sleep well, dear Aunty, sleep well.
Mr. & Mrs. Olubamidele Elempe-in-laws
It’s sad, yet an honor to pay a tribute to a very special and irreplaceable person in my life- my beloved sister-in-law. I have struggled with what to say, and where to start. There are so many beautiful things to say about Aunty B, as I fondly called her. How would I explain the kindness in her heart, the infectious joy and the depth of her love? How could I be able, to sum up, her beautiful life writing? In all, she meant a lot to us all. Aunty B, your memory is a keepsake from which I’ll never part. Good has you in His arms, but I have you in my heart always. Sleep on, till we meet to part no more.
Munirat Omokide-sister-in-law
A heart so beautiful inside and out…heaven just received a gem. You will be sorely missed…
Ozavize Ogunmefun- sister-in-law
Alight from our family has gone out! A voice we loved and cherished is now still. I wish God could have spared you if just for a few more years. Osi- Kamilu (as fondly called, we hold you close within our hearts and there you remain for all of us, whom you gave your best. Now the time has come for you to rest. So, go in peace, for you have earned your sleep. Your vacant place no one can fill. We miss you now and always will.
Rali- sister-in-law
How much of a tribute can we really pay for such an enigma of a woman that would be adequate and satisfying? A woman of integrity. She was hardworking, always smiling, a cheerful woman whom we will never forget. She always contributed to the progress of the family. A dependable ally and a unifier, a rare gem, and a loving sister. In fact, we are yet to come to terms with the reality of your transition to eternal glory. My solace is that you lived a worthy and fulfilled life. My sister, Bose, Osi Kamilu, we thank you for being there for us all while your life lasted. Despite your departure from this sinful world, we will continue to cherish your loving memories. Rest in the bosom of our Lord Jesus Christ. Shalom!
Mrs. H.T.Aliu & children
Aunty B( as I fondly called you) how can I possibly sum up all that you represented in your time. Is it the kindness in your heart, the contagiousness of the joy you exuded, the genuineness of your intentions, or even the depth of the of your love? You were simply remarkable by every standard. You were not only beautiful on the outside, but also a beautiful soul who always saw the beauty in others. You added color to our family. You included us in your life with your presence, your love, your support and your encouragements. You gave so much, loved so much and now you have left a vacuum too much to fill. Words cannot describe how much she will be missed. However, I surrender to the superior will of God trusting that His will is good and His timings perfect. You’ll live forever in our hearts. Aunty B thank you so much for being such a blessing to our family and a special sister and friend to me. I will miss you, but I am eternally grateful to God that our paths crossed in your lifetime. Farewell Aunty B! Continue to rest in peace until we meet at the Lord’s feet.
Razak Omokide -Brother-in-law
You left like a candle in the wind, clothing us in grief and mourning, leaving a gap that will forever remain too big to be filled. You were the strength of the household of Omokide, the pillar that we all lean on, the “everybody’s” confidant, the secret of our unity, our quiet influencer, untiring encourager, our faultless peacemaker. I mourn, not because I have lost hope, but because I long for one more conversation with you. Well, I rest in hope that you are in a better place. Blessed are the peacemakers, for they are the sons of God. Go well, thou daughter of the Most High. We will love you forever.
Wakilu Omokide- Brother-in-law)
Aunty Bose, a woman with a golden heart!” charm is deceptive, and beauty does not last; but a woman who fears the Lord will be greatly praised. You were indeed a woman after God’s heart. You died for love and passion you had for your immediate family and that of the Omokide’s. You showed us love irrespective of your tribe and ethnicity. You were not just a wife, but a woman of virtue, a woman we could call our own. In deep tears, I remember when you called me to pray for my sick husband from the UK, just a few days before his demise. I was surrounded after the funeral of my late husband when the news of your death came to me on your way to mourn with me (your little sister-in-law). Oh! It was indeed a double tragedy! Your passion for love will sustain your home, God will comfort your husband and your children till we meet again.
Evans- Egure Memunat (Nee Omokide)- sister-in-law
Dear Aunt, I still want to ask why you didn’t stay alive to see what I will become. Your words of advice have reformed my life profitably. Indeed, you are more like a mother to me! You were always there when I needed you; a blessing to my life. Know that your absence has created a big vacuum in our hearts and has brought endless tears to our eyes, but I know you’ll always want us to be happy. I love you so much and I know you are resting in the bosom of the lord. Rest in peace, my beloved Aunt.
Oluwatobi- Nephew
Your life was a blessing, your memory, a treasure. You are loved beyond words and missed beyond measure. Till we meet again. Farewell our dear wife/sister, Aunty B.
Efisue & Latty Gomina- in-laws
Sweet mother. You were exceptionally intelligent, unique and beautiful. You were beautiful both in and out. So kind and gentle. You always had my back. I feel so fortunate to have known and learned from you because you are special and loved by all; I will always remember your sweet smile. A fighter, a goal getter, my mother, and teacher. Losing you at such a time scares my soul because you made me who I am today. I will love you now and forever, I will miss you dearly, Goodbye Mum till we meet to part no more.
Favor Akpan-Daughter (Adopted)
You have always cared for me like my Mom will do. I wished I was more outspoken when you were around. We rehearsed songs; always pushing everyone to bring out his or her hidden talent. We know you are resting by his grace we shall meet again in heaven.
Onavi- Cousin (in-law)
Bosede, your demise is not a loss, but again so says the word of God. Your absence left a vacuum in our hearts which only God can fill. We shall miss you greatly, however, we rest in the fact that we shall meet again on resurrection morning. Adieu, my lovely sister.
Akin Ilupeju- Brother
My loving sister, I am proud and happy that I had someone like you for a sister. You were a gift to us and especially to me. Every moment spent with you was a special memory and I can never forget you in my life. It’s not fair as you left me like this with all the plans we had together. You never said it was going to be this soon. You were always there for me. I find it difficult to believe you are gone, however, I will never forget you, I will always miss you, dear sister. Rest in the Bosom of the Lord, because I know you made it to heaven. I love you so much…my twin.
Bola Ilupeju
My cousin! My sister! My Mum’s carbon copy!!! Aunty Bose!!!! A woman of faith, very industrious, hardworking and an epitome of a woman of visions and dreams. We talked about everything and anything. You always provided a listening ear and always had a word of advice to share. I screamed and wailed at the news of your demise and I have not ceased to ask questions. My heart sinks at the thought that I may not see you anymore in this life. I am yet to accept this fate. Now, I bless God that Mum has gone to rest before this day. Abosede, your sudden departure has left a deep hole in our hearts. I can only pray that the Lord strengthen the loved ones you left behind. You walked with the Lord- I am therefore certain that the Lord will preserve and keep your children.
Joke Opaniran(cousin) and family.
It is hard to put into words how I felt about your sudden departure, Aunty Bose! The natural emotions of loss and nostalgia poured over me. A strange sense of frustration as I try to bring to mind your facial expression, your voice and most of all your personality. You were full of ideas, hardworking and served God all your life. It is so unfair to lose you now- no! I don’t have answers as to why you have to leave your beloved ones now. I remember the last time I saw you in London, two weeks before the sad news f your departure. I gave you a birthday wish a week before your death. It is difficult to accept you are gone. Farewell, Aunty Bose! Farewell!! We love you but God loves you more. Rest on. –
Olaitan Leigh and family (cousin).
“And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, ‘write’. Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: yea, saith the spirit, that they may rest from their labors; and their works do follow them”. Sister Bose…our dearest sister, our friend, our confidant, our counselor. Writing this hit us badly, really, really badly. Our hearts are in pains: how can we be writing this for you, Mama B!! How?? Without a goodbye? Just like that? You had big dreams, big plans…our hearts have broken into a million pieces; this nightmare has refused to go away. We still can’t believe we will not see your smiling face again, we will not hear your voice again. Just three ago, we had an amazing family time together. We talked about so many things, you had so many plans, amazing plans we dropped you off at the airport with hugs and goodbyes. You were so full of life and energy, as usual, all smiles and then we get this devastating news speechless…but God knows best. We are grateful for the time we had together. They are memories we will cherish forever and forever. The children are heartbroken, they are constantly asking us questions, but we have no answers. Nevertheless, God knows. He knows and sees what we don’t. Rest well our darling sister, till resurrection morning. It will never be the same without you, but it is well with our souls.
– Oris & Emmanuel Aidenojie- bosom friends
I still cannot believe you are gone! Oh, how I wish I could turn back the hands of time; how I wish, I hugged you more deeply and told you I loved you over and over again. As I remember that unfaithful day of your demise, it is still unbelievable to have sat by your side and suddenly, in a twinkle of an eye, death snatched you away from us. How can I come to terms with the fact that I will never hear your voice calling me ‘Mary Mary’ again; that I will never see you again and take our usual pictures ehnn…! You were a wonderful mother, a great wife, a wonderful friend and sister, an industrious entrepreneur, and more especially a lover of God and the things of God. You took on so much with a smile, oh that smile, oh that smile that could melt heart away. Aunties B are you truly gone? The assurance we have is that you have gone to be with the Lord singing with the angels and smiling down on us. Well, you are now resting in the bosom of the Lord. We take solace in the word of God: “our brothers and sisters, we want you to know the truth about those who have died so that you will not be sad, as are those who have no hope. We believe that Jesus died and rose again, and so we believe that God will take back with Jesus those who have died believing in hi”. Thank you, Aunty B, for loving us so much, for touching our lives in so many special ways and for truly leading by example. You will be greatly missed.
Mary Omokide (sister-in-law)
Some 20 years ago, my brother introduced us to this wonderful woman, Mrs. Bose Omokide (Nee Ilupeju). They have been married these years, blessed with godly children, lived a beautiful and exemplary life filled with great memories. Today, we pay this tribute in her honor. Sis. B as we fondly call her is the embodiment of the virtuous woman of Proverbs 31- never weary in doing good, her hands in the industry and her faith ever strong ministering to the needs of all and sundry.
We remember her today as a virtuous mother to her children and several other children around her. She made friends with and earned the confidence of her children, teaching them the faith in Christ Jesus. This we have seen demonstrated these few days as they took in the shocking news f her sudden departure.
We remember her as the chief mobilizing officer of the women in the family. She will call and challenge our wives to wake up and stand in the gap in the place of prayer for us the men and then the whole family. She has always believed that prayers were the weapon we have in God to overcome the evil of this world and realize our true potentials in life.
We’ll surely miss her hospitality. I can’t remember any time during these years she did not have guests in her home. Her kitchen ever busy. We know that we are guaranteed the real pounded yam whenever we visit. This is who Sis. B is!
She has an incurable love for worship. The first love that saw her return to the studios to express her love for God in worship. I had the privilege of listening to one of her practice sessions recently and still have that scenes fresh in my mind as she passionately sang the hymn” Abide with me, fast falls the eventide…”
We remember her as a bridge builder in the family. Facilitating and working for peace in all ways and at all times. We particularly will miss the love and care she has shown our parents, their attire at special family events and occasions. She has been the personal dresser for our aged Dad. We sure will miss this peacemaker.
Her hands were never idle. Active in the industry, always finding the next opportunity to pour her energy and passion. This trait has seen her establish La’ Sharone and birth other businesses in s short a time. She raced against time to express herself in industry, as if trying to ensure that she pours out her all, leaving no abilities unused.
Again, I can’t but speak of your faith. You never left anyone in doubt about your firm belief and faith in God, Jesus Christ, and His resurrection. Worship, passionate worship was your thing and we know that you have joined the saints above in adoration of our Heavenly Father. You have rested from your labors until the sound of the triumph of God! Sleep on dear Sis. B, till we meet at the feet of the Lord!
