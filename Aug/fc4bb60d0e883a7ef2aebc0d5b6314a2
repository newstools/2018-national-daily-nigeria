Acting General Secretary of Nigeria Football Federation, Dr Emmanuel Ikpeme has appealed to Nigerians to remain calm over the invasion of the NFF secretariat by some operatives of the Department of State Services , DSS, who assaulted him today on resumption of duty,National Daily learnt.
Dr Ikpeme expressed shocked that operatives of DSS, paid by taxpayers money, could lay siege at the secretariat of the Football House, and also assault him without any provocation.
“I had just driven in, parked when some people walked up to me. I tried to introduce myself to them, when they asked me to enter my car and drive off. I was walking towards my car to leave, when from behind they started pushing me,” he explained.
“I am shocked to say the least by what happened at the Glasshouse today by operatives of DSS, even without identifying why and who sent them to lay siege at a facility that has no threat to public peace,” Emmanuel stated.
The Acting General Secretary noted:”We are law abiding citizens, we will not take laws into our hands, but will continue to explore the path of peace and justice to settle every score”.
He, however, averred: ” We want to appeal to anyone, who is behind the DSS invasion of the serene football house to advise them to quietly leave the premises as their action has been reported to the relevant authorities for investigation and appropriate action.”
” More worrisome is their penchant for chasing staff away once it is 4pm, irrespective of what assignment they are doing, which has affected productivity and morale, with most staff, now struggling to come to work,”he  pointed out.
” I have kept quiet over time believing common sense will prevail, but the action against me today was a confirmation of the fears of most staff that their personal security was under threat with gun welding DSS operatives walking around everywhere,” Ikpeme  posited.
