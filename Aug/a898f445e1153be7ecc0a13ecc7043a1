Former President Olusegun Obasanjo has taken his mobilization for a strong coalition to unseat President Muhammadu Buhari of the All progressives Congress (APC) in 2019 to former President Goodluck Jonathan in Bayelsa State who he so despised during the 2015 general elections. Former President Obasanjo since his January 2018 famous treatise wherein he admonished President Buhari to not to contest for second tenure in 2019, has mounted vehement campaign within and outside Nigeria, mobilizing political forces to ensure Buhari does not return to the seat of power in 2019. Accordingly, Obasanjo visited Jonathan on Monday at his country home in Otuoke, Bayelsa State.
National Daily gathered that former President Jonathan acknowledging Obasanjo’s visit, posted this on his Facebook: “Hosting former President Olusegun Obasanjo yesterday. I am firmly of the view that Nigeria will progress faster when great leaders, like President Obasanjo and other statesmen, plant trees whose shade they know they may never enjoy. A view shared by this great Nigerian and even greater son of Africa.”
Obasanjo pulled Jonathan to the mud during the 2015 general elections while he endorsed Buhari to succeed the former President and dismantle4 the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Today, Obasanjo is at war with the same Buhari he supported  to oust Jonathan in 2015, and turning to Jonathan for an alliance against Buhari.
Before Jonathan, Obasanjo had visited former head of State, retired General Ibrahim Babangida, retired General T.Y. Danjuma, Afenifere group, as well as Afenifere leaders like Chief Reuben Fasaranti, Chief Ayo Adebanjo, and others.
Several northern leaders who include Professor Ango Abdullahi, have also been consulting Obasanjo on hte battle to unseat Buhari in 2019.
