Elder Statesman ,Edwin Clark has called for sack of the Minister of Sports and Youth Development, Mr Solomon Dalung, for allegedly discrediting Vice President Yemi Osinbajo for recognising Amaju-Pinnick-led Board of the Nigerian Football Federation (NFF),National Daily gathered.
The elder statesman, who made the call in a statement on Saturday in Abuja, said reports of “disloyalty and parochial utterances’’ credited to Mr Dalung in various media reports were embarrassing.
According to Clark, for the minister to discredit the very patriotic and timely intervention of Osinbajo as Acting President, to recognise the Amaju Pinnick-led Board of the NFF is unacceptable.
The elder statesman further said there was no sense in the minister of sports discrediting a laudable action that saved Nigeria from ban by the world football governing body FIFA.
Clark quoted Dalung as saying, “as a barrister and solicitor of the Supreme Court of Nigeria who took oath of office to defend the constitution of the Federal  Republic of  Nigeria, I will  prefer to stand with the Rule of Law, instead of the opinion of men.
He stressed that Osibanjo had for decades, taken the oath of Office to defend the same Constitution and the Rule of Law.
“I also swore to the same oath when I qualified as a lawyer 53 years ago. What is the minister talking about defending the constitution and obeying the rule of law?
“Another clear case is when Mr President directed the Department of State Services (DSS), to flush out Mr Chris Giwa and his subordinates from the Glass House, Dalung was not only believed to have encouraged Giwa’s return.
“He is reported to have facilitated the resurrection of the leadership feud within the NFF, which undermines the great successes of the Amaju Pinnick-led NFF on the nation’s towering football engagements,’’ he said.
