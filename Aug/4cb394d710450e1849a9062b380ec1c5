The Federal Government has described as good riddance to a bad rubbish the defection of the Senate President, Bukola Saraki from the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to the opposition party, the Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP).
Recall that Saraki officially announced his defection to PDP on Tuesday, July 31, follow suit by the governor of Kwara state, Abdulfatah Ahmed and the APC spokesman, Bolaji Abdullahi on Wednesday.
Addressing journalists after the Federal Executive Council meeting on Wednesday, Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed said that Saraki’s exit was a big relief to APC.
He said Saraki was always an opposition in the ruling party, who used his position as Senate president to frustrate the workings of the government, adding that the senate president had become the greatest obstacle to the government.
Mohammed, expressed doubt over the party membership of Saraki. “I don’t think the government would have suffered more as regards the delay in passing the budget. The Senate president, Dr. Bukola Saraki, has behaved all along as if he was a member of the opposition”, he said.
The minister said APC stands to lose nothing with the defection of Saraki and his loyalists, adding that the party in his native Kwara state would grow stronger with the exit.
He also said the leadership of the Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP) in the state has also defected to APC “demonstrating their rejection of Saraki’s return to their party.”
