The EFCC and an aide to President Muhammadu Buhari are out with each other over the allegations that Senate President Bukola Saraki has infiltrated the anti-graft commission.
Buhari’s special adviser on political matter, Babafemi Ojudu, in an article Fifth columnists in our recent history’ accused Saraki of instigating the Department of State Services’ blockade of the National Assembly and the EFCC’s recent clampdown on Benue and Akwa Ibom accounts.
“From the shenanigans at the Benue House of Assembly to the siege on National Assembly, the attack on judges home in the night, the so-called barricade of the Senate President’s house, the laughable kidnap of Boy Dino and ‘his 11 hours on a tree’, the freezing of the Benue and Akwa Ibom accounts all are scripted, produced and acted by Oloye (Saraki) Productions,” Ojudu wrote in the article.
But EFCC’s spokesman Wilson Uwujaren said the presudetial aide is misinformed.
The anti-graft agency advised Ojudu and other politicians to do proper investigation before making allegations
“The recent placement of a ‘Post No Debit Order’ on some accounts in Benue and Akwa Ibom states were the culmination of many months of painstaking investigative activities. To reduce such activities to the level of a stunt in a real or imaginary script by any politician is outrageous,’ said Uwujaren.
“It is important to state that the EFCC is not a party to the so-called script by Saraki. Members of the public should disregard the innuendo in Ojudu’s article as it is unfounded.”
Except Ojudu states his fact, the political paths of the EFCC helmsman and Saraki have never crossed since 2015, though latest revelations after the fall of the DSS former boss Lawan Daura indicate the Senate president had in-road to the spy agency.
