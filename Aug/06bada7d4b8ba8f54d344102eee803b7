The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has accused the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for keeping deadly silence over the controversy that unspecified numbers of Permanent Voters Cards allegedly discovered at the residence of the former Director General of the State Security Service (SSS), Lawal Daura in a search operations by a security agency.
National Daily learnt that PDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, protested that the silence of the INEC over the allegation raises suspicion of purported fore-knowledge or suspicion of accomplice in the illegal possession of numbers of PVCs by an individual who is legally entitled to have one PVC.
 Ologbondiyan, however, appealed to the two chambers of the National Assembly to immediately conduct investigations into the allegation.
There have been videos clips showing the discovery of N21 billion, weapons and high figures of Permanent Voters Cards (PVCs) by security operatives who conducted search at the residence of former DSS Director General, Lawal Daura, in Abuja and Daura, Katsina State, after his sack by the Acting President, Professor Yemi Osinbajo following the illegal invasion of the National Assembly last Tuesday.
However, DSS image maker, Tony Opuiyo, in a statement on Monday in Abuja refuted the authenticity of the report on the sum of money and unspecified number of PVCs said to be found at Daura’s residence.
