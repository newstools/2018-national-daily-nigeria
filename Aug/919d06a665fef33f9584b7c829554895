Nigeria coach Gernot Rohr has finally broken his silence on the retirement of one of his key players, Victor Moses, from the national team, saying that he hopes that the decision of the striker is not cast in stone,National Daily learnt.
Today will make it nine days that the Chelsea number fifteen, a former England U17 star,  called time on his international career with the Super Eagles, citing the need to concentrate on his family and club.
It is foregone conclusion that Moses will not be called up for the upcoming 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Seychelles as a result of his announcement last week.
”We spoke already and I hope that his decision is not definitive,” Rohr said.
“I think it depends on his motivation. If he really wants to commit himself again, he is welcome.
Moses represented Nigeria at two World Cups in 2014 and 2018 and was a member of the squad that won the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations in South Africa,National Daily gathered.
