National leader of the All Progressives Congress, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, says Nigeria need a focused and determined leader like President Muhammadu Buhari to gradually re-engineer the country’s economy.
Tinubu who made the remark on Wednesday in Lagos during the Eid-el-Kabir celebration, said the administration of President Buhari is the foundation for re-engineering and reinvigorating Nigeria’s economy for a better future.
”Foundation is crucially important. I have listened to the people. I have been in contact with them at the grassroots. Even this house is not spared too, from demands from the poor and the needy, but without re-growing the economy, re-tooling, re-engineering the economy, we will not have anything. ”
“There is a lot of hope, there is a lot of expectation, but when the treasury was empty, when the salaries were outstanding, when the quality of life is low, what will you do?
“We have oil, they didn’t save money and we have not diversified the economy. We have eaten our dinner for breakfast, nothing in the kitchen. There is no magic about it. It takes dedication, commitment and perseverance. Yes, we might not be communicating effectively with the people but we are working to make things better,” he said.
He urged Nigerians to make sacrifices, endure, tolerate and forgive one another in the spirit of Eid-el-Kabir celebration. “When you pray for forgiveness, you must be able to give forgiveness if you think you deserve forgiveness.”
Meanwhile, President Buhari in his Sallah message to Muslim faithfuls posted on his twitter handle, called on Nigerians to rise above personal interests and promote harmony in the nation.
