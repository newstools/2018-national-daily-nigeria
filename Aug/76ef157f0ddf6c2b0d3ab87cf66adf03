Deputy Governor resigns




By SUNDAY ODIBASHI
The memorandum of understanding existing between Senator Rabi’u Musa Kwankwaso and former Governor Ibrahim Shekarau to towards the onerous agenda of recovering Kano State for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and unseating Governor Umar Ganduje has begun to reconfigure the political equation of the state. Several political and state actors have keyed into the 2019 project of their political principals, making costly decisions to resign their exalted appointments and elected offices.
The Deputy Governor of Kano State, Hafeez Abubakar, on Wednesday defected from the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), to join his principal, former Governor  Rabiu Kwankwanso, who had defected to the PDP on July 22, 2018, in the mass defections in the National Assembly.
National Daily gathered that the PDP, in a statement, disclosed that Abubakar had petitioned the Inspector General of Police on Monday over threat to his life and harassment by the APC-led State Government.
The PDP however, welcomed the defectors to tis fold. PDP in the statement declared in part:  “The party therefore has no doubts that Governor Tambuwal will indeed contribute immensely towards the rebuilding of our dear nation on the platform of the PDP. The PDP states that the return of Governor Tambuwal, Senate President Bukola Saraki, Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom, Kwara State Governor, Abdulfatah Ahmed, and Kano State Deputy Governor, Prof. Hafizu Abubakar, in addition to scores of federal legislators to the party, reflects the wishes and aspirations of Nigerians across board, who are now resurging to the repositioned PDP as the only vehicle to rescue our nation from the mis-governance of the APC.”
