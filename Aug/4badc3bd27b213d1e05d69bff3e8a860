Senator Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso, former Governor of Kano State, on Wednesday, declared for the 2019 presidential race on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Abuja.
The former Kano Governor was not deterred by the action of the Police who barricaded the Eagle Square, Abuja, and also cordoned the Abuja International Conference Center, to deny the Senator use of those federal facilities for the declaration to contest the presidential election in 2019.
The former Kano State Governor held the declaration event at Chida Hotel, Utako, Abuja, where thousands of his supporters trooped out en-mass to cheer him.
The ruling All Progressives Congress federal government had denied Kwankwaso the request to use the Eagles Square, Abuja, for the declaration on Wednesday 24 hours to the event.
