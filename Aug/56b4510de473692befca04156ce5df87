The President of the Senate, Dr. Abubakar Bukola Saraki, immediately after the World Press Conference in Abuja on Wednesday departed for Minna, Niger State, for a consultation meeting with former Head of State, General Ibrahim Babangida.  The Senate President had a closed door meeting with former Military President Babangida during the visit which lasted for few hours.
National Daily gathered that Saraki arrived Minna International Airport at about 4.10pm. The meeting was gathered to be connected with the rising political violence in the country, threats to national integration, amongst others. The senate president was said to have shared the bitter experience of the State Security Service (SSS) invasion of the National Assembly on Tuesday.
There were innuendoes that the consultation visit was also extended to the speculated intention of Saraki to join the Presidential race.
The senate president has been going through serious political antagonisms since emerging the Presiding Officer of the Eighth Senate.
Babangida had at different times been identified with advocacy for generational leadership transition. He had been providing advice for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on the need to present credible presidential candidate in 2019 to unseat President Muhammadu Buhari.
Meanwhile, official details of the Wednesday meeting between Saraki and Babangida are yet to be revealed.
Saraki is, however, yet to make formal declaration for the 2019 presidential race.
