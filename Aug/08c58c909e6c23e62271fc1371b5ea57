Signed by Manchester United as a 19-year-old for £26 million in 2007, he was expected to be a mainstay in their midfield for many years to come.
But he failed to develop as hoped during his stint at Old Trafford.
He spent seven and a half years at the club, playing 181 times and scoring 12 goals, before eventually leaving the club in 2015.
Anderson Luís de Abreu Oliveira’s career has only been downhill since. The Brazilian moved back to his homeland with Internacional, but his stay at the club did not go as planned.
He enjoyed regular first team football, something he was never given at Old Trafford, but he still couldn’t prevent the Brazilian club from being relegated for the first time in their history.
He then moved to Coritiba on loan, where he suffered relegation from the Brazilian top flight yet again.
And, after failing to impress upon his return to Internacional, his contract with the club was terminated in January.
Poor guy. He has really struggled to fulfil the potential that many saw in him.
But, six months after hitting rock bottom, Anderson looks to have got his career back on track.
The Brazilian had struggled to find a club since leaving Internacional, but it was confirmed today that he had signed for Turkish club, Adana Demirspor
