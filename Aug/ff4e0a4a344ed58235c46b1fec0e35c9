The Promise Keepers central defender,Dennis Nya, was on the score-sheet again for his club in their friendly match against Akwa Starlets which ended 2-0 and he is happy to occasionally come forward to get some goals to complement the effort of the strikers.
“I don’t see myself taking the job of the strikers,  but adding to their job. It is always a pleasure to help my team out in any capacity I am called upon,” Nya told National Daily .
He added that “I scored another goal last week in our game with Akwa Starlets. I like to occasionally go forward if the condition arises and I have got some few goals in the process of doing that. It is the happiness of every footballer to see his team progress and I will be glad to do anything to help my team.”
Dennis hinted that their good mid-season form will enable them to approach their remaining league games better than they did in their previous 24 matches and that it is their resolve to displace Lobi Stars at the top of the NPFL log.
“We have had some many impressive results in our friendly matches but we are not carried away by it. We know that these good results will guide us in our remaining matches,” the defender continued.
“We are doing everything possible to ensure that we end the season as the best team in the league. We want to erase the two points’ gap between us and Lobi Stars and build up our own lead.”
