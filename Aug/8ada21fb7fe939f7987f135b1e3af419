The Nigeria international  Tyronne Ebuehi sustained damage to his left anterior cruciate ligament and is expected to be out of action for a prolonged spell,National Daily gathered.
Ebuehi faces a lengthy spell on the sidelines after suffering a serious knee injury during Benfica’s International Champions Cup defeat to Juventus on Saturday.
The right-back who joined the Portuguese giants from ADO Den Haag in June replaced André Almeida in the 67th minute as his side bowed 4-2 on penalties to the Italians at Red Bull Arena after scores stood at 1-1.
And the Primeira Liga runners-up have now confirmed the 22-year-old defender will go under the knife to repair the damage.
More tests will be required before a timescale is possible for Ebuehi’s recovery, but his injury will be a blow to Rui Vitoria’s men, who are due to face Fenerbahce on August 7 in the Uefa Champions League.
Before his injury, Ebuehi had featured in Benfica’s 4-3 penalty triumph over Borussia Dortmund in the International Champions Cup clash on July 26 at Heinz Field
