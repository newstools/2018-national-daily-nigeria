The All Progressive Congress (APC) has targeted Enugu State as one of the political entities in Igbo land to plant the party and uproot the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in 2019.
APC leaders were of the view that the failure of the PDP in providing good governance for citizens in the state would facilitate APC’s defeat of the PDP and the incumbent Governor, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi.
Ifeanyi Nwoga, a former Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice in Enugu State, declaring for the governorship election on the platform of APC on Saturday at the Nnamdi Azikiwe Stadium Enugu, stated that some critical sectors such as education, health, water and sanitation infrastructure, among others have been in shambles all through the years of the PDP government since 1999, promising to turn the tide.
Nwoga had declared: “Our people have been taking for granted for too long, so, if it pleases God, and man, (you people), I will be contesting for the Governor of Enugu State in 2019 on the platform of APC. I will run an anti-corruption led government.
“I have not come here to run down or castigate anybody, but to address issues as they affect our people, because APC does not believe in hate speech.”
The Enugu State APC Chairman, Dr. Ben Nwoye, noted that with the declaration, the dynamics of 2019 politics in the state has changed. He maintained that Nwoga has increased the governorship aspirants in the state to three, jostling for the APC ticket.
Nwoye appealed to Enugu State indigenes and South East people to embrace the APC in Igbo land. The state chairman assured that APC has formidable structures in the south east to defeat the PDP in 2019.
