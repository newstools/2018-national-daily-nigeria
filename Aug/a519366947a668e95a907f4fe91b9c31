Former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar has reacted to the demolition of Yinka Ayefele’s Music House which houses his Fresh FM 105.9 radio station,National Daily gathered.
It was reported that the building belonging to the popular musician was demolished in the early hours of Sunday by the state government for allegedly contravening its town planning laws.
Reacting to the development, Atiku expressed sadness over the loss of jobs.
On his Twitter page, he wrote: “The reports of the demolition of a radio station in Oyo fills me with a deep sadness. Press freedom is sacrosanct.
“It’s equally saddening that at a time when jobs are badly needed, a radio station which was providing jobs is needlessly demolished.”
Also Senator Ben Murray-Bruce condemned the development.
According to him, Ayefele would be given an award in America for providing jobs for Nigeria rather than have his building demolished.
On his Twitter page, he wrote: “If Yinka Ayefele had built that radio station in England or America, he would have received an award.
“He built it in Nigeria to provide jobs and he received bulldozers instead. Yet we say we want investors.”
