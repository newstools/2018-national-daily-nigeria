The United States Embassy in Abuja, on Monday, announced that it will resume full services on August 24 for both visas and American Citizen Services (ACS).
National Daily gathered that the Embassy, however, remarked that consular services at the U.S. Consulate Lagos were never affected and will continue unaltered.
The Embassy in a statement declared:  “We regret the inconvenience this interruption of service in Abuja has caused.
“Visa and ACS applicants with scheduled appointments for August 24 should come to the Embassy, as usual.
“Visa and ACS applicants with cancelled appointments between August 13 and August 23 will be contacted by the Embassy for rescheduling.
“Visa and ACS applicants who were requested by an officer to appear again for follow-up questions on existing applications should contact our office to arrange a new date.”
The U.S. Embassy had suspended consular services in Abuja Tuesday, last week in the height of political tension in the country. Though the Embassy did not specify particular reasons for the closure, it indicated that because of the development, it would be temporarily unable to provide regular services for visa and American Citizen Services in Abuja.
