Real Madrid have had a difficult summer transfer window and are reportedly struggling to lure big names to the club this season. The brutal reason being that Los Blancos are no longer seen as as big a lure to players after the departures of star player Cristiano Ronaldo and manager Zinedine Zidane, according to Diario Gol. The report suggests big names like Manchester United star Paul Pogba have been on Real’s radar, but he is listed as one who would rather join Barcelona. 

Madrid finished third in La Liga last season, a whole 17 points behind champions Barca, though they won the Champions League for a third season in a row. Despite that, the team looks to be in decline after the blow of losing Ronaldo and Zidane without adequate replacements.  

New manager Julen Lopetegui is not nearly as big a name and lacks experience at this level in club football, despite his stint in charge of the Spanish national team. In terms of signings, Thibaut Courtois is the most high-profile player to come in, with no marquee signing up front to replace club legend Ronaldo. It remains to be seen if the club can get something done late on before tomorrow’s transfer deadline, but it looks like being a difficult year ahead at the Bernabeu.
