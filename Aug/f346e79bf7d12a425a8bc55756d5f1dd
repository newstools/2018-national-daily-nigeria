Paris Saint-Germain coach Thomas Tuchel has admitted he’s unsure if Adrien Rabiot will stay with the club this season.
The midfielder has been heavily linked with a move to Barcelona all summer. However, having brought in Arthur and Arturo Vidal it’s unclear if the club retains an interest.
Rabiot featured for PSG in Sunday’s 3-0 win over Caen, scoring their second goal, and Tuchel spoke about him after the win.
“It’s not certain if Adrien stays at PSG. It all depends on him,” said Tuchel.
“For me he’s a great player. He can grow even more and become a top player.”
The 23-year-old’s contract expires next summer, and there have been reports he’s turned down the offer of an extension.
PSG don’t appear to be willing sellers, but they may be tempted if an offer comes in to avoid him leaving for free next year.
He was frozen out of the starting eleven under the then manger, Unai Emery who now heads Arsenal after the dismissal of Arsene Wenger, who has served the club for 22 years.
