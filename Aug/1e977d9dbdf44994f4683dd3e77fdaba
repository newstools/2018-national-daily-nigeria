The Management of Lobi Stars Football club of Makurdi has threatened to drag Difaa El Jadidi to FIFA over the transfer fee of striker Antony Okpotu, who joined the Moroccan side July 8, 2018.
The media officer of the club Uja Emmanuel told National Daily in an interview that it is a fact that Okpotu had an existing contract with Lobi stars which necessitated the transfer deal between the two clubs.
Uja disclosed that so far management of Lobi stars is yet to collect a dime on the player’s transfer deal.
He expressed the displeasure of the management over the delay by the Moroccan club to pay the transfer fee on Okpotu as was agreed upon and urged then to honour the agreement signed with the Makurdi side ,otherwise the matter would be reported to FIFA.
The Media explained that the clarification became necessary following rumours making the rounds that Okpotu’s transfer fee had been received and squandered by the management .
Emmanuel  concluded that  with such rumours are plan to distract the club by those who are not happy with the impressive performance of the Team   in  NPFL .
