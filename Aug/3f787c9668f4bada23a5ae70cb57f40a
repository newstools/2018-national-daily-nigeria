Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu has responded to speculation over the future of Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba.
Pogba captained United and scored in their first game of the Premier League season in a win over Leicester on Friday.
But the Frenchman’s future at the club is under significant scrutiny, with his post-match quotes only adding fuel to the fire.
Barca were thought to have ‘privately accepted‘ that United will not even entertain a sale this summer after the Premier League transfer window closed last week.
But club president Bartomeu opted not to rule out a move when asked on Sunday.
“Pogba? I won’t speak of any names, we have respect for all clubs and there are 20 days left,” he said.
“We’ll see which players come out. We’re focused on La Liga, so it’s best to ask [Eric] Abidal, [Ramon] Planes or Pep Segura about players.
“There’s still time to do business.”
