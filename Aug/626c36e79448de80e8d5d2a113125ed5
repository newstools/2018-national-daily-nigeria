Should Arteta seek to go it alone, with Henry set for Bordeaux and Vieira already in his second managerial post, the race to be Arsenal’s next manager could be very interesting if Emery screws this up.
However, former Arsenal defender Ashley Cole is demanding that Unai Emery is given time in his new job. Speaking to ESPN FC, as reported by the Metro, the LA Galaxy defender explains that Emery needs to be given time after replacing Arsene Wenger in the dugout.
“I used to watch the games with [Wenger] in the long jacket and you don’t see that no more. But times change, people move on, and I think it was his time to go.”
“And obviously they’ve brought in a new manager with new ideas and a new philosophy. I think it might take a little bit of time, he has to gel the players together, he’s got a few new players. To put his philosophy across and how he wants to play, I don’t think it’s going to happen straight away.”
The new Gunners boss has already come in for some criticism after trying to implement a new style of play. Arsenal have shown signs of promise under Emery, as the squad look to learn to his philosophies.
There have been clear signs that Emery is keen to play the ball out from the back, something that was not so much of a focus under Wenger.
