The United Nations Department of Safety and Security on Monday provided security advisory services over planned attacks by terrorists in the North East, Nigeria, during the Eid-el-Kabir festival.

The UN Department of Safety and Security on their website, noted that the Federal Government of Nigeria had declared Tuesday and Wednesday, 21 and 22 August 2018 as Public Holidays to mark the Muslim Eid El Kabir Festival. It remarked that “the period will be marked with high attendance of prayers in Mosques and praying grounds followed by ritual sacrifice and family visits;” admonishing that: “While UNDSS does not have specific information on any impending activities by extremists, there are unconfirmed reports of planned attacks across Borno St ate and other states in the North-East.” The Department, then, cautioned that, “Therefore, all staff members are requested to take precautionary measures by reducing their exposure by avoiding places that could be symbolic targets for PBIED attacks.”
UNDSS recalled that Eid El Kabir celebrations in North East, Nigeria, in the previous years witnessed upsurge in the threats of terrorist attacks from Boko Haram insurgents. “The security trend analysis is still very predictive of the likelihood of direct or indirect attacks of Small Arm Fire (SAF) and Light Arm Fire (LAF); PBIED attacks in Eid prayer locations; Shopping malls and market places ; Vehicular grid lock due to intensive military check  points and movement restriction with in and around Maiduguri city; Collateral impact due to nearness to  military locations; Kidnapping; House break in and common theft to be high during the festivities,” UNDSS cautioned.
Accordingly, UNDSS stated that the best mitigation measure remains to minimize self-exposure.
It recommended certain generic security measures to UN Staff as follows:
· Maintain high degree of alertness and security awareness always.
· Remain aware of your surroundings, including local events. Monitor local news stations for updates that may be disseminated from time to time.
· Review your personal security arrangements.
· Avoid crowded public areas and gatherings.
· Review and limit errands to popular commercial places to reduce exposure.
· Ensure that personal emergency communication system remains functional always.
· Report any suspicious activity to UNDSS that they may notice around their offices or residential premises, to enable UNDSS to coordinate appropriate action through Host Government Security response.
UNDSS further directed all security staff, including contracted security guards at all UN compounds, to take following actions:
· Remain on high alert and to detect and immediately report any hostile surveillance of UN premises.
· Strengthen access control procedures in place to prevent and deter any unauthorized access.
UNDSS also reminded staff that prior and during festive season such as Eid El Kabir, they are likely to see a surge in criminal activity for obvious reasons of material gains, noting that such crimes involve house break-ins and robbery incidents. “It is, therefore, advisable that staff members review their residential security and take the necessary actions to redress the identified weaknesses,” it stated.
It was highlighted that other crimes may involve forcefully breaking in to vehicles at parking lots of shopping malls, entertainment places, banks or even on the streets.
“Most of these incidents are normally triggered by visible and unattended items like bags, laptops, packages, phones and other valuables left in vehicles,” it warned.
Therefore, all Staff Members/personnel were directed to strictly adhere to the following advice:
· Keep doors locked and windows rolled up at all times while driving, especially, during traffic hold-ups or at stop lights.
· Avoid driving alone late in the evenings.
· Ensure that valuables are out sight to reduce the potential for smash and grab robbery.
· Choose the right parking place preferably where the vehicle is clearly visible to all from afar.
· Never leave visible items unattended in the vehicle for even a few minutes.
· When stopped or asking for directions; only open the car windows not more than 10 to 12 cm to prevent snatching from outside.
· Do not stop to help strangers on the road side
· Keep to the main roads and avoid lonely dark areas or short cuts
· Ignore beggars and street vendors at stop lights
· If using a hired vehicle; do not leave your valuables behind – irrespective of how short or long time you will take.
· Do not talk on phone while driving; find a proper parking on the roadside, keep doors locked and windows rolled up
· Do not use your phone with the windows down, even if you are not driving. Phone snatching through the window are common in traffic jams.
· Do not carry original documents such as Passport and Laissez Passer etc. if not travelling out of the country.
· If possible, alert a guard to watch over your vehicle for a small tip.
· Do not leave your car engine running when you are not inside.
It further warned that heavy road traffic and congestion is expected during the festive season and staff members are advised to practice safe driving and factor this in their travel plans.
