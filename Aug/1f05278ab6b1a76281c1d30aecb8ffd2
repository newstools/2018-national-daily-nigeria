The raging crisis in Kano State is beginning to throw up fresh uncertainties in the state. After the impeachment of the Speaker of the House of Assembly and his replacement, the Deputy Governor, Professor Hafiz Abubakar, on Wednesday, resigned and defected to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) accusing governor Umar Ganduje of threatening his life, an allegation, Ganduje aptly denied.
Accordingly, Kano State Government on Thursday, expressed surprise over allegation by the Deputy Governor, Professor Hafiz Abubakar, of threat to his life.
The Commissioner for Information, Youth and Culture, Malam Mohammed Garba, in a statement in Kano, described Professor Abubakar’s statement  as not only unwarranted but unfair to the State Government.
The Commissioner in the statement indicated that the State Government advised the Deputy Governor to make a choice to quit or remain in Government.
”To prove that the allegations made by the Deputy Governor were false, he was at yesterday’s State Executive Council meeting, with fewer security aides.”
The Commissioner for Information maintained that despite the unguarded comments by the Deputy Governor, the Government continued to accord respect and support for his office.
 Meanwhile, the Deputy Governor is expected to not only resign his membership of APC but also resign his office as the deputy governor of Kano State.
