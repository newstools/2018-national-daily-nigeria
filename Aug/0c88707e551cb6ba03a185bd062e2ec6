Oyo Governor Abiola Ajimobi has met with Yinka Ayefele, the owner of Fresh FM recently demolished last Sunday morning.
The meeting took place Thursday, and a panel has been set up to look into the incident.
The governor said the demolition was neither a witch-hunt nor politically motivated, insisting that it was due to the contravention of the state’s property laws.
Desribing Ayefele as a good man and responsible citizen, the governor stated that the next step was to find a compassionate means of solving the problem.
He also urged Ayefele to ensure that his radio station report the incident responsibly.
Alaafin of Oyo Oba Lamidi Adeyemi, who was at the governor’s Office  with some monarchs, also pleaded with the Ajimobi to resolve the impasse.
Ayefele said that his office responded to all the letters forwarded to it by the state government.
He expressed regrets at not being able to see the governor, adding that the emissaries he sent failed to deliver his messages.
He assured the governor of his readiness as a law-abiding citizen to comply with the regulations of the state government.
