The Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP) has challenged the Buhari Presidency and the All Progressives Congress (APC) to end its silence and speak out on their evident complicity in the corrupt amassing of the N21bn, guns and thousands of Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) allegedly found in the residence of President Muhammadu Buhari’s ally, the sacked Director General of the Department of State Services (DSS), Lawal Daura.
In a statement by the party made available to National Daily by its spokesman, Kola Ologbondiyan, PDP said the discovery has not only exposed the shameless hypocrisy of the Buhari Presidency, but also stripped it of all integrity and brought its deceptive saintly posturing to a disgraceful end.
“Today, the sneaky ways of this Presidency have further been exposed and it must not in any way seek to disown the sacked DSS DG as Nigerians already know that he was merely one out of the numerous agents being used by the APC and Presidency cabal in their nefarious activities, including warehousing money, fake PVCs and weapons to be unleashed during the 2019 elections.
Ologbodiyan in the statement  said Nigerians are already aware of the leaked memo detailing alleged underhand oil contracts to the tune of N9 trillion at the NNPC and the Ministry of Petroleum Resources, which are under the direct supervision of Mr. President.
“They are already aware of the alleged stealing of over N25 billion, meant for the health needs of the people, from the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) and how the indicted and suspended Executive Secretary was recalled by Mr. President.”
Ologbodiyan also alleged that the alleged diversion of crude oil worth N1.1tr, using 18 unregistered companies; the diversion of N18 billion Internally Displaced Person (IDP) funds and billions of unremitted revenue from sale of crude for which there have been deadlock at the Federal Accounts Allocation Committee (FAAC), all of which are being swept under the carpet by the Buhari Presidency.
He therefore challenged President Buhari to tell the nation how these corruption acts were allegedly perpetrated under an administration that lay claim to integrity.
