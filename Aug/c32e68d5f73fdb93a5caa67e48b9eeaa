Sergio Ramos has taken aim at Cristiano Ronaldo following the Portuguese’s move from Real Madrid to Juventus.
Ronaldo swapped the Bernabeu for Turin over the summer in a near £100million move after establishing himself as arguably the best player in Los Blancos history.
“It’s obviously a negative when you lose a player like Cristiano Ronaldo, but we can continue to win and in Real Madrid’s history many have come and gone, but Real Madrid continue to win.
“No one is above Real Madrid, whatever happens Real Madrid will continue to live on and it was his choice to leave. The decisions are not mine to make, but the doors are always open to those that want to be part of Real Madrid
Despite four Champions League titles and becoming Real’s all-time top goal scorer, Ronaldo suggested Juventus was more of a ‘family’ than he had in the Spanish capital.
But Ramos is adamant that there is a close bond among the Los Blancos squad – and told Ronaldo no player is bigger than the club.
“Here were have always felt like a family, so I don’t know what he was talking about,” he said. “We have had lots of success, which is because we are a family and he was part of that family, which we have continued to have.

“Losing Ronaldo was hard, but no player is above Real Madrid and we still have the hunger to improve and win more titles. The mindset we have is more important than any individuals in the team.”
