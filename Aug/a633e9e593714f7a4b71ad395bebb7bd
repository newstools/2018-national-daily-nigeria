The operatives are turning away cars of lawmakers and one of those that have been prevented from gaining entry into the national assembly is Rafiu Ibrahim, senator representing Kwara south.

National Daily learnt that Ahmed Lawan, senate leader, and some senators elected on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) met with Lawal Daura, director-general of the DSS, at about 1am on Tuesday.

It is not yet clear what the agenda of the meeting was about and no explanation has been given for why the security agency is turning back national assembly staff and lawmakers.
