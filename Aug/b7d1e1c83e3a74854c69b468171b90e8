Defeated by France in the semi finals of the World Cup with Belgium (0-1), manager Roberto Martinez returned to this meeting in an interview with the HLN.
“I could read in the eyes of my players all the disappointment associated with this elimination … The cloakroom was in shock. The whole team believed in the title of world champion !, he said. To return to the same game, France has indirectly made us a great compliment playing as defensively. I was amazed by the defensive play of offensive elements such as Griezmann or Giroud.
I think that the way to play the French was dictated by the trauma of the final lost at the European Cup in France against Portugal in 2016. They certainly have not been better than us. They scored on a corner, that’s … Sometimes a defeat is necessary to become number 1! “
