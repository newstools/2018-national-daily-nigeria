The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has taken a swipe at the decision of the former Minority Leader in the Senate, former Governor Godswill Akpabio of Akwa Ibom State who defected to the All Progressives Congress (APC) on Wednesday.
PDP National Chairman, Prince Uche Secondus, was of the view that it’s unfortunate that former Senate Minority Leader Apkabio preferred to walk against the tide to endanger his fine political career.
Prince Secondus in statement by his Media Adviser, Ike Abonyi, decried that he finds it very strange that anybody would go into a sinking ship at a time every other person is finding their way out of it.
He stated that whatever caused Akpabio’s action must have been for self-preservation and not borne out of any rational strategic political decision.
The National Chairman said that Senator Akpabio’s decision does not enjoy the blessing of the people of Akwa Ibom whose mandate he enjoyed for eight years as state governor and nearly four years now as a senator.
“I cannot fathom any reason why on earth Senator Akpabio should work against the tide, moving at opposite direction to a place every reasonable persons are escaping from.
“He deserves our pity because whatever would make somebody to chose bad for good is clearly one that he should be prayed for salvation especially given the fact that wolves are waiting for his arrival to devour him.
“How on earth can anybody who has his eyes wide open be seen walking into danger knowingly?
