Kaduna State was thrown into pandemonium after violence erupted in two communities – Kwaru and Ungwan Yero. The resurgence of violence in the communities compelled the Kaduna State Government to impose 24 hours curfew which restricts movement round the clock in those communities.
The Media Aide to Governor Nasir El-Rufai, Samuel Aruwan, in a statement explained that the decision to impose such comprehensive curfew was taken after a review of the security situation in the communities.
Aruwan maintained that residents of the two communities have been advised to comply with the directive, noting that security agencies have been directed to vigorously enforce the curfew.
National Daily gathered that the curfew was declared after fresh attack by some gunmen on Sunday evening. The gunmen went on rampage in Malali, a neighbouring community to Kwaru-Unguwar Yero, Kaduna State, attacking residents.
It was noted that the violence was believed to be gang-related with residents, pointing out that the attackers were from Badarawa, and that they attacked residents of Unguwan Gado in Malali area of the state.
It was gathered that the Sunday attack took place few days after two people were killed in an upsurge of violence in Kwaru and Unguwar Yero communities; both communities were identified to be proximity to the scene of the renewed violence.
