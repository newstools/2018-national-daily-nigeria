One of the foremost long-distance race runners in Nigeria, Deborah Pam has expressed great delight at the introduction of the Lagos Media Marathon Race.
Deborah who finished as the first indigenous female runner at the 2018 Access Bank Lagos City Marathon and same at the Okpekpe international 10km road race explained the planned Lagos media race is a welcome development that should be well supported.
“This is great news for me, I will be more than happy to be there to compete and run alongside the journalists that have been showcasing us to the world,” Pam told National Daily
The beautiful runner who has won several titles for herself across the length and breadth of Nigeria revealed that she is already training ahead of the National Sports Festival also fixed for December; hence it will be good for her to run in Lagos before heading to Abuja for the festival.
The Nigerian top runner noted that with more marathon races across the country, Nigeria’s long-distance runners can begin to compete favourably against the Eastern African powerhouses like Kenya.
She noted that what the Kenyans have going for them is many races and support from the authorities.
With over 20,000 runners expected in this inaugural edition of the Lagos Media Marathon, Yusuf Alli, the General Manager for the Access Bank Lagos City Marathon who will also oversee the maiden Lagos media race explained that the 10km race will be in two categories; first for media practitioners and second for the public.
