Senators initially denied access to the National Assembly complex Tuesday have been allowed in, and are now condemning the siege.
The DSS, allegedly aiding the pro-Buhari lawmakers bent on impeaching defector Sen. President Bukola Saraki on Tuesday.
The APC and PDP senators had initially shelved the impeachment battle till resumption on September 25 when the house will reconvene.
However, no fewer than 30 senators were said by some lawmakers to have met last night with the director-general of the DSS Lawan Daura to hatch the impeachment plot.
The pro-Saraki senators’ statement could not be confirmed.
But as the security agency lifted the siege, Kwara Sen.Rafiu Ibrahim was first to arrive among the senators.
“We got here this morning to go into our office as usual; I work very early. During recess we do committee works and our own writings. I’m writing a book, so I go in there almost every day,” he said.
“We got here and DSS has taken over all the gates, all entrances to the National Assembly and they said it’s order from above. We asked them why, they said there is no reason. As it is today, it means Nigeria is under siege.”
Bayelsa Sen. Ben Murray-Bruce too aired his viewm saying the action is condemnable.
He particularly targeted a colleagie of their in the PDP said to be interested in taking over from Saraki.
“I have contacted the UK and US Embassy to revoke the visa of Senator Akpabio or anybody leading this assault on this institution,” said Nurray-Bruce.
“We will ask them to revoke the visas of their wives and that of their children. They will not be allowed to leave Nigeria to travel to any nation in western Europe and North America,” he said.
Akpabio is expected to defect from the PDP to the ruling All Progressives Congress.
Other candidate for the Senate top job is Majority Leader Ahmed Lawan.
