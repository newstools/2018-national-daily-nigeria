Chelsea’s World Cup winning midfielder N’Golo Kante has admitted that going all the way with France in Russia this summer was ‘beyond his dreams’.

The 27-year-old started all seven of Les Blues’ games as they matched their achievement of 1998 by lifting the famous trophy, beating Croatia 4-2 in last month’s final.

Kante now has his eyes on a third Premier League crown in four years, and a second with Chelsea, but the ex-Leicester City ace insists that he will never take his job for granted.

“We are lucky to be playing football for a living. For me, this is what I have always wanted to do. To get to this level is all down to Allah’s blessing,” he told The Mirror. “There are millions of ­people out there, who every day want to get the opportunity to do the work we are doing and it’s a short career.

“That is why I give it my all at every given opportunity. I am lucky to get the ­opportunity to play for France and that alone is a huge motivation for me, whenever I go on the pitch. To represent one’s own country is one of the biggest achievements a ­footballer can get.

“To play for your nation on the world stage is worth more than money can ever buy, and I get to do that, so I am very ­fortunate. To win the World Cup in our colours was beyond my dreams and something I will never, ever forget.

“To be able to be part of that group will stay with us until the end of our lives ­because we know what ­winning the World Cup means to us.”

Kante played the full 90 minutes for Chelsea as they beat Huddersfield Town 3-0 at the weekend, less than a month on from France’s World Cup success.
