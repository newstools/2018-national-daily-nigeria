The National Executive Committee (NEC) of the All Progressives Congress (APC) on Thursday adopted direct primary election to nominate the partyâ€™s presidential candidate for the 2019 election while reversing similar division on the primary election of governorship and other candidate.
AOC at the National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting at the national secretariat, Abuja, resolved to limit direct primary election for nomination of candidates to the presidential candidate while adopting the indirect delegate election for governorship and other candidates after protest by APC governors.
The APC NEC, however, directed states that may adopt direct primary election to notify the National Working Committee (NWC).
It was gathered that attendance at the meeting included President Muhammadu Buhari, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, APC National Leader Bola Tinubu, APC National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole, APC governors and many other party leaders.
