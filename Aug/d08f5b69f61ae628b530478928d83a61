Chairman of the Nigeria Football Supporters Club, NFSC, Rev Sam Ikpea has advised that the retirement decision of Super Eagles player Victor Moses should be respected.
Ikpea told National Daily that  Moses is one player that has given his best for the National team even though many will agree that the Super Eagles still need him.
Ikpea explained that great players like Austin Okocha, Joseph Yobo, Kanu Nwankwo, Finidi Gorge,Victor Ikpeba retired to give way for players like John Mikel Obi, Ahmed Musa and even Victor Moses.
” Victor  has played in the world cup twice and has attained the highest stage of his profession.”he added.
Clergyman revealed that is in the best position to understand the reason why he chooses to retire from the National team at this stage”.
” Nigeria have so many talented footballers that are waiting to showcase their talents and if the senior players do not give way they cannot be discovered to serve their fathers land”.
Moses took the decision to retire after the FIFA 2018 Russia world via his Twitter handle, citing family reasons.
