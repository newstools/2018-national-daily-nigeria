The President of the Senate, Dr. Abubakar Bukola Saraki, on Wednesday condemned the last minute cancellation of the approval granted to Senator Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso to utilize the Eagle Square for his 2019 presidential declaration.
Asraki, in a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Yusuph Olaniyonu, in Abuja, remarked that the “Eagle Square belongs to all Nigerians” and the cancellation sends a wrong message about the tolerance level in our politics.
“The refusal to allow Senator Kwankwaso to utilize the Eagle Square for his Presidential declaration, despite an earlier approval, sends a wrong message about our democracy, particularly the tolerance level in our politics.
“That square belongs to all Nigerians because it was built with public funds. We hope this is not what we will be seeing as we approach the 2019 General Elections,” the Senate President declared.
Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso was denied access to the popular Eagle Square as well as the Old Parade Ground for the declaration of his presidential intention on Wednesday
The former Kano State Governor, however, made the declaration at Chida Hotel, Utako, Abuja, where thousands of his supporters trooped out en-mass to register their support.
