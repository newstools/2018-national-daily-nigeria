Advocates independent Judicial Panel of Inquiry




A frontline presidential aspirant on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), former Vice President Atiku Abubakar on Tuesday eulogized Acting President Yemi Osinbajo for his prompt intervention to save Nigeria from sudden collapse of democracy following the invasion of the National Assembly by the State Security Service (SSS) in the early hours of Tuesday.  The former vice president commended the acting president for positively responding to the clarion call of Nigerians and taking action to halt the illicit and anti-democratic siege on the National Assembly by operatives of the SSS.
Former vice President Atiku in a statement by his image manager, Paul Ibe, remarked that deciding to fire the Director General of the DSS, Lawal Daura, by fiat, the acting President has given meaning to the cries of Nigerians that they will not tolerate such anti-democratic actions.
Atiku in the statement declared: “The former Vice President gives his utmost support to this action and calls on all statesmen and political leaders to put aside partisanship and rally round the acting President during these fragile times for our democracy.
“Furthermore, the Waziri Adamawa calls for an independent judicial panel of inquiry, to investigate today’s incidence at the National Assembly to get to the root of the matter so that those responsible can be identified and punished.
“These are delicate times for Nigeria and all lovers of democracy and the rule of law must be extra watchful lest anti-democratic forces take advantage of all we have worked hard to build.”
