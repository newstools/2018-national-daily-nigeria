 Paul Pogba pledged to continue giving his best for fans, team-mates and ‘the people that trust me’ in the wake of renewed speculation about his Manchester United future.









 
Two years after returning to Old Trafford from Juventus in a world-record deal, the 25-year-old is reported to be so unhappy that he has informed executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward of his desire to leave.
United have denied that happened and the same outlet said that Mino Raiola, the player’s agent, had even struck a deal with Barcelona – the kind of interest that the club have vowed to reject.
A tense relationship with Jose Mourinho appears to be at the heart of it. Questions about their relationship were raised last term and the midfielder is said to have been annoyed by his manager’s comments around the World Cup.
Paul  that it looked like he was fully committed to United after a lot of things had been said about his position at the club over recent days, he added: ‘Well, like I said, I always give my best for the fans, for the team-mates and for the people that trust me.’
Pogba’s focus on trust seemed pointed, as did his post on Twitter shortly after the match.
All does not appear well behind the scenes, despite Mourinho saying on the eve of the Leicester match that when the media ‘repeat 1,000 times that my relationship with my players is not good, it’s a lie that (is) repeated 1,000 times’.
But it is not just the manager’s relationship with United’s players that has come under inspection, considering he was irked by executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward failing to strengthen the squad before the transfer deadline
