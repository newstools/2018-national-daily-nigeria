Former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, on Thursday in Enugu, affirmed that he has outstanding pedigree that makes him outstanding as the most qualified aspirant to be Nigeria’s President in 2019.
At a consultative meeting with Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) stakeholders towards the party primary election to nominate the presidential candidate, Atiku declared: “the 2019 election is not merely another presidential election. 2019 is about an opportunity to restore vibrancy to the economy. It is an opportunity to get Nigeria working again. I present myself to be elected president based on my experience as Vice President when our economy was creating more jobs, my experience as an entrepreneur of note and my credential as a detribalized Nigerian.
“This is the most crucial election in Nigeria. Today, we have the highest unemployment in the history of Nigeria. We have the worst experience of insecurity in the history of Nigeria.
“These are challenges to which I have a track record of experience and capacity to handle better than any of the other contenders for president in next year’s election.
“I am experienced. I have served as the Vice President and chairman of the National Economic Council when the economy of this country was growing at seven per cent. In my private capacity and to the glory of God, my companies here in Nigeria have created thousands of jobs for Nigerians.
“At a time like this when Nigeria is going through division everywhere, my record as a detribalized Nigerian speaks for me. I have my investments dotted in the landscape of Nigeria and I stand for a united, peaceful and prosperous country for all.”
He maintained: “This election is very important than the others before it. Make sure you get your PVCs to enable you vote, and when you vote make sure that you protect your votes.”
