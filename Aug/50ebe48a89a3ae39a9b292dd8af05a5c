Cristiano Ronaldo was “angry” at his failure to win the UEFA Player of the Year award, according to Juventus boss Massimiliano Allegri,National Daily learnt.
Ronaldo, who joined Juve in July after scoring 15 goals as Real Madrid claimed the Champions League crown for the fourth time in five years, finished second in the voting behind his former Santiago Bernabeu team-mate Luka Modric.
Modric had a fine season, capped by helping Croatia to the World Cup final, but it was nevertheless a surprise that Ronaldo was not chosen by a panel comprised of the 80 coaches in the Champions League and Europa League group stages as well as 55 journalists.
“On Thursday, he was angry because he won the Champions League and scored 15 goals. This shows that he always wants to be the best.”
As for his decision not to attend the award ceremony in Monaco, Allegri said: “It was a personal decision and it must be respected.”
