The world’s fastest man has graced the football pitch in a professional capacity for the first time as Usain Bolt made his debut for A-League side Central Coast Mariners,National Daily learnt.
On trial with the Australian club, Bolt came on in the 72nd minute of a friendly match against a Central Coast select side with the Mariners already leading 6-0.
While there were a few heavy touches from the Jamaican, he was getting himself into some dangerous positions – twice denied headers from close range and was only inches away from a tap-in after 90 minutes.
It wasn’t all smooth sailing for Bolt however, who was forced to take off a golden necklace a few minutes after coming on and was sweating profusely as the full-time whistle went.
There’s clearly still plenty of work to do for the 32-year-old if he is to earn an A-League contract, but time is on his side, with the Mariners vowing to give him as long as 12 months to get him up to speed.
