Revelations from Aso Rock have fuelled further speculations that the presidency and the ruling APC are at variance on the villainy or heroics of the DSS boss dismissed August 7.
Femi Adesina, media aide to President Muhammdu Buhari, told the State House correspondents in Abuja on Wednesday that Acting President Yemi Osinbajo is too decent to have acted unilaterally in dismissing DSS boss Lawan Daura, for invading the National Assembly, Nigeria’s sanctum of democracy.
Daura is one of the members of the so-called Aso Rock cabal believed to be pulling the strings at the centre of power.
Responding to the DSS siege on the NASS, the APC issued two statements in two days, first discrediting and later commending  the siege by men of the DSS at the command of Daura.
“We are now aware that the timely intervention of the security operatives forestalled the planned violence which could have led to possible deaths, injuries and destruction of property in the National Assembly on Tuesday,” the second statement by the party Acting national publicity secretary read.
The party believes the PDP and Senate President Bukola Saraki intended that day to impeach President Buhari vacationing in London, and Daura saved the day.
But the Presidency on Wednesday insisted Osinbajo was not alone in dismissing Daura, indicating the DSS boss erred.
And that there is no power struggle between Osinbajo and his boss.
“When something like what happened yesterday (Tuesday) would happen then there will be unanimity, there is no way there won’t be unanimity on that kind of decision,” said Adesina.
