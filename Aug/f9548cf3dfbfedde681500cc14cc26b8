The failure of Junior Lokosa, the top scorer in the Nigeria Professional Football League ( NPFL), to secure a deal abroad with SK Brann of Norway has been traced to issues not entirely connected with his abilities on the pitch,National Daily gathered.
Lokosa who has 19 league goals for Kano Pillars this season in the NPFL scored four goals in his first training session with ‎the team and that immediately sparked talks of an imminent deal.
However two days later, the club informed the 24 year old that he won’t be offered a deal and immediately asked him not to bother turning up for training. A move which a source close to the deal explained
” Let’s say he was decent in training but he wasn’t professional enough to earn a deal. For instance he turned up for training late on two different occasion, I don’t think that helped his cause to bag a deal”, he explained.
” The coaches felt he didn’t show enough professionalism, hence their decision to bring his trial to an end. He was due to play a test game on Sunday but they couldn’t wait for that day”, he remarked.
