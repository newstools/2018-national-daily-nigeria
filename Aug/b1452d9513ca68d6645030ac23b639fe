The DSS has denied it found a huge sum of money and weapons in the house of the sacked director-general of the agency, Lawal Daura.
According to Tony Opuiyo, a spokesman of the agency, there is no iota of truth in the story that N21bn and permanent voters card were found in Daura’s houses.
“The attention of the Department of State Services has been drawn to the circulation of fake information and videos in which several items were said to have been recovered from the Katsina and Abuja homes of its immediate past Director General, Lawal Daura,” Opuiyo said.
“These non-existent items include: N21bn cash, 400 assorted and sophisticated small arms and light weapons/rifles, and thousands of permanent voters card belonging to Niger Republic immigrants.
“In another video also in circulation, some persons believed to be personnel of a security outfit were seen forcing open safes stocked with money. The security operatives were described as executing a recovery operation at the Katsina home of the former DGSS.
“Consequently, the service wishes to inform the public that these videos are false and should be disregarded. So far, no such recovery operations have been undertaken by the EFCC or any other security agency at DSS’ office or residences of the former DG.
“There is no doubt that different interests have continued to give varied accounts of the incident of last week at the national assembly.
“It may, however, be recalled that the presidency had pledged to carry out a detailed investigation regarding the alleged national assembly siege.”
Opuiyo asked members of the public to exercise restraint in their narration of events.
