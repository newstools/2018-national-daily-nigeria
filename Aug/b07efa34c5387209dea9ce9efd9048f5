A new champion has been crowned after a meeting between the club owners and the league management company (LMC) after 24 round of games in the Nigeria professional football league,National Daily gathered.
The league was put on hold for the world cup  in June but little did we know that the NFF saga will spring up its ugly head again and the crisis stretched beyond imagination which made the league organisers to suspend the league indefinitely.
The onus lied on the league organizers to ensure that the remaining 14 games is played in a space of one month to determine the league winner  who will represent Nigerian in the CAF champions league so as to meet up with the October 15th deadline for submission of Nigerian representatives to CAF.
Looking at the short space  of time and the cumbersomeness of fixtures achieving this is as tall as climbing the “Eiffel tower” as teams have to play three games per week (weekend- midweek- weekend) and most of the club chairmen complained that their principals (state governors) lacks the financial war chest to prosecute these matches within these period, fatique on the part of the players who normally travel by road across the length and breath of the country to honour npfl games and also the Aiteo cup fixture was also put into consideration.
After an extensive meeting of the club chairmen and the league organizers (LMC), a unanimous decision was taken with fourteen out of the twenty chairmen voted that the league be wrapped up at this point and the trophy be handed  to the team that occupies the number one spot after 24 games with only six voting against the motion,but like we all know it majority carries the vote.
This is not the first time the makurdi landlords will be winning the tittle they won it in their debute season in the then Nigerian premier league in 1999 and went as far as the semi finals of the CAFCL before they were knocked out by Accra hearts of Oak in 2000.
Lobi stars are not new on the continent they have represented the country in both CAFCL and CACCC in 2000 and 2004 respectively and they have all it takes to fly the country’s flag high on the continent, the Vice chairman of the club Mr Mike Idoko is an  man who knows the business under his watch Sunshine stars played semi finals back to back and they were ranked the 14th best team in Africa,he was the team manager of Lobi stars when the team gained promotion from division 3 to 2 from there they came tops and won themselves a slot on the Nigerian premier league in 1999 where they crowned champions of the league even as new comers.
Much respect must also be accorded to the technical adviced of the team Coach Solomon Ogbedei whose technical input has propelled the team thus far we look foward to seeing a better LOBI stars in the continent later this year.
