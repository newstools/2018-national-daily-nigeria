PSG will not recruit Danish midfielder Tottenham that the English press sends to Paris for 110 M €.
Paris Saint-Germain will not recruit Christian Eriksen (26), the Tottenham midfielder. The club of the capital denied us this rumor appeared a few weeks ago, and resumed yesterday by the English newspaper Sunday Express. According to the British media, the club of the capital would be ready to make an offer of around 100 million pounds (about 110.4M €) to snatch the Danish international (82 selections) Spurs.
This information is all the less credible as the PSG is not currently able to pay such a sum either for Eriksen or Ivan Rakitic, the middle of Barcelona, that the Catalan press regularly sends to Paris. As we point out in our editions of the day, the club of the capital always under the impact of a survey of the UEFA related to the financial fair play, must first degrease before thinking to recruit. And in the five days remaining before the closing of the transfer window, the sale of Gonçalo Guedes – presumably in Valencia – is a priority option.
If successful in this case, the Paris staff may then consider recruiting a priority left side. And to a lesser extent, a midfielder who will not be Eriksen anyway in talks to extend with Tottenham.
