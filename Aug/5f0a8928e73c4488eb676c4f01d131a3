The former Arsenal manager landed in Liberia on Wednesday as he prepares to receive the country’s highest honour from Weah.
Wenger joined him to take in some action at a match between two local teams at the Samuel Kanyon Doe Sports Stadium outside Monrovia on Thursday night.
After retiring from football in 2003 Weah entered politics, and won last year’s election by a landslide. The award ceremony will take place in the capital, Monrovia, on Friday.
In the past he has had only positive things to say about Wenger, claiming he ‘took care of me like his son’ when he went to Monaco, adding that ‘besides God, I think that without Arsene, there was no way I would have made it in Europe’.
Wenger has called Weah’s life story ‘a miracle’. ‘I remember when I saw him the first time at Monaco, coming in a bit lost, not knowing anybody, not being rated by anybody as a player and becoming the best player in the world in 1995 and today becoming the president of his country,’ he remarked in January.
