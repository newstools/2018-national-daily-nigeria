Messi has been well-fitted with the stripes of the first captain and in good faith he has been exercising since the first day. One more test is the dinner that has called the Argentine crack for tomorrow. All the players in the template are invited. A dinner of brotherhood that will serve to welcome the new signings and perhaps to say goodbye to someone who is about to change airs, like Alc√°cer or Rafinha. Also to make a plot for a season where it seems that the Champions has become a real obsession as well recognized by Messi himself during the parliaments on Gamper Day.
At dinner only players are invited, so no one is expected from the technical staff. Valverde encourages these initiatives. That is why he has planned two consecutive trainings in the afternoon, both on Tuesday and Wednesday, so that players can enjoy the evening without setbacks. The last time the entire staff met for dinner was the celebration of the double last season. The difference is that on that occasion it was an institutional dinner of the club where members of the board also attended. Messi has given the dinner on Tuesday a more informal tone.
