A Federal Capital Territory High Court has ordered the EFCC to suspend investigation into the alleged complicity of Senate President Bukola Saraki in the Offa Bank robbery.
The court gave the order following an ex-parte application Saraki’s 10 lawyers filed, asking the court to suspend the interrogation of their client pending the determination of the motion brought before it.
In the July 30 motion, the lawyer requested for the court to restrain the police or their agents from arresting, interrogating, harassing or attempting to detain Saraki or infringe upon what they called his fundamental rights.
On Wednesday, Justice M. A. Nasir granted the application, and gave the order.
“The respondents are directed to stay all further actions related to the suit, pending the determination of the originating motion, which is hereby fixed for hearing on August 16,” the court ruled.
Saraki has refused to appear twice before the police authorities at tha Abuja Force headquarters where he was to be questioned on the April 5 robbery at Offa, Kwara.
The police said some arrested suspects indicted Saraki, making it necessary for the senate president to explain his role in the robbery during which over 30 people died.
But the Senate president has insisted he is being persecuted by the APC and Aso Rpck because of hos defection to the PDP.
