The Speaker of the House of Representatives Honourable Yakubu Dogara has reportedly withdrawn plans to defect to the Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP) from the All Progressives Congress (APC).
National Daily gathered that Dogara has plans to return as Speaker in 2019 and to do so, he must be a member of the party that wins the most seat. The APC still controls the majority today with about 186 members as against PDP’s 162.
“The fear now is that if he hurriedly defects to the PDP to contest the election, his chances of returning as a speaker if the APC retains the majority become a tough call,” a reliable source told National Daily.
“On the other hand, if he remains in the APC to contest the election and the PDP captures the majority, it will be another problem for Dogara because the PDP, now hungry for power, will pick one of their own.
“A third option, which appears more appealing, is for him to stick with the APC, hoping it will retain the majority. He can then work across parties to get enough votes to remain the speaker.”
Ado-Doguwa who is the chief whip of the House urged Dogara to stay in the APC. He said: “I am also authoritatively aware that up till today, Dogara is a faithful member of the APC, and still ready for further negotiations on the perceived bitter relationship with his state governor.
“I, therefore, urge the national leadership of our great party to dispassionately intervene on the Speaker’s issue in Bauchi State and bring it to a logical conclusion.
