Abductors of Talatu, wife of Hosea Akuchi, pastor of a Baptist church in Kaduna, have demanded a N5 million ransom for her release.
The victim was abducted after her husband was killed while resisting the kidnappers at their residence in Guguwa, Igabi local government area of the state.
The tragic incident happened on Sunday morning.
A source in the church said the suspected kidnappers contacted a family member on Tuesday to make known their demand.
“The abductors called today to say that we need to pay them N5 million before they can release her to us,” the source said.
“They called a family member on the phone to make this demand. Imagine such demand after killing the reverend just like that. How can this injustice continue in a country like Nigeria without any serious measures in place to check the activities of these people.
“You can imagine that, they have the guts to walk into people’s home, kill and abduct and also have the effrontery to demand for ransom. Where and how can we get that money? How can we become prisoners in our own country as law abiding citizens?”
