PDP Defector Godswill Akpabio has tackled some of his colleagues in the National Assembly for linking him to the plot to impeach Senate President Bukola Saraki during the Tuesday siege on the National Assembly by the DSS.
Speaking at an APC rally organised in the state on Wednesday, the former senate minority leader said some of his colleagues who were at the National Assembly Complex on Tuesday might have taken tramadol.
According to him, some of them went there without shoes, and he had no idea of what they were doing in the complex when the House was on recess.
“I even called security to help take them home, because some of them must have taken Tramadol,” he told the rally in Ikot Ekpene.
He then took at Bayelsa Sen. Ben Bruce, who said Akpabio was behind the alleged plot to impeach Senate President Bukola Saraki.
“I shouldn’t have mentioned his name but because he believes in lies, Ben Bruce,”he said.
“How can I stay in my house and he starts shouting that I am in the national assembly just to damage my name?
“I was inside a plane to join you yesterday and he was shouting look at what Akpabio is doing to us.”
Akpabio joined the APC when scads of his colleagues in the APC are trooping to the PDP, which was why it amazed Ben Bruce.
