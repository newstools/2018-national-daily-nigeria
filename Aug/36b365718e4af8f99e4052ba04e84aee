WBC’s world heavyweight champion Deontay Wilder says there is “ no question ” he will fight Tyson Fury this year.
The 32-year-old argued with Fury ’ s team at Friday’ s weigh -in for the Englishman’ s bout with Francesco Pianeta in Belfast coming up on Saturday .
Wilder told BBC Sport , “As soon as he gets this guy out of the way, it ’ s done. That’ s how simple it is.”
Wilder ’ s manager Shelly Finkel told BBC Sport the bout will be in “November or December in New York or Las Vegas” .
Asked for a message for 30-year – old Fury , Wilder said , “Be ready . I’ m coming to knock you out, plain and simple . ”
Pianeta will be Fury ’ s second opponent since the former unified world heavyweight champion took a two – and- a -half – year break from the sport as he battled depression and was given a period of ineligibility by UK anti – doping .
Finkel said Wilder will be ringside for Saturday ’ s bout, and he said he loved the “ energy ” of Friday’ s weigh- in as it provided him with a view as to what a bout with Fury would be like.
“ It’ s an excitement and is making the whole thing even better , ” Wilder told BBC Sport.
