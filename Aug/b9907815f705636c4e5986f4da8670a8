Resigns duties to Lagos Consular Office




The consequences of the political tension in Abuja, Nigeria’s federal capital may have begun to penetrate the international community some of who have started to reconsider their activities in the Federal Capital Territory.
National Daily gathered that the United States Embassy, on Tuesday, announced that Embassy has indefinitely shut its visa and consular services section in Abuja. The Embassy, however, directed everyone in need of such services to contact the Consular Office in Lagos. According to a post on the Embassy’s website, “Scheduled visa and ACS applicants for Abuja will be contacted for rescheduling.” There was no reason from the Embassy, however, on the new development. The Embassy, however, made arrangements for handling emergency needs of US citizens resident in the North.
The US Embassy declared: “Until further notice, all consular appointments at the U.S. Embassy in Abuja have temporarily ceased for both visa and for American Citizen Services. Consular functions in U.S. Consulate Lagos are not affected and will continue.
“American citizens in northern Nigeria with emergency services needs should continue to contact the after-hours emergency number for Abuja at 09461-4000 and press “0” to go to the operator to request assistance.
“American citizens in northern Nigeria with urgent travel needs who are traveling before Tuesday and who are willing to re-schedule their travel through Lagos should contact the ACS office at Consulate Lagos ( 01460 3400 and LagosACS@state.gov) to discuss their options. Those traveling after Tuesday should follow up with Abuja ACS to confirm their appointments closer to their appointment date.”
