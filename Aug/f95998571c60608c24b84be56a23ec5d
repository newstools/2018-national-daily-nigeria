In a statement issued by the apex bank on Tuesday, the money which was distributed among various segments of the market showed that the CBN offered $100 million to authorised dealers in the wholesale segment of the market while the Small Medium Enterprises (SMEs) segment got the sum of $55 million.

According to figures from the Bank, customers requesting Forex for invisibles such as tuition fees, medical payments and Basic Travel Allowance (BTA), among others, were also allocated the sum of $55 million.
