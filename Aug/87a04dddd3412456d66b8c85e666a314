Juventus boss Massimiliano Allegri has warned against complacency in Serie A this season, despite the signing of Cristiano Ronaldo,National Daily learnt
The 33-year-old joined from Real Madrid in a club-record â‚¬112million deal last month and is in line to make his first appearance in Italy’s top flight on Saturday, when the champions visit Chievo.
Ronaldo’s arrival came as part of a substantial overhaul of the first team, with Joao Cancelo, Emre Can and Mattia Perin also joining, while Leonardo Bonucci returned from AC Milan and Douglas Costa secured a permanent move from Bayern Munich.
Allegri admits he has the strongest squad in the division at his disposal but insists they cannot take the Scudetto race for granted this term.
“The first game is a novelty. It’s really interesting to see how teams play,” he told a news conference ahead of the start of their title defence.
“Cristiano has won five Ballons d’Or, he’s been training for 10 days and you can see he’s a different player. He’s no ordinary footballer. He’s an important motivator for all the other players,National Daily gathered.
