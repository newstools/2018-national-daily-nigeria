Former Governor Peter Obi of Abanvra State on Channels Television Breakfast Show specified 10 strong points on leadership management of the Nigerian economy in a debate with a professor of economics at University of Abuja.
Here are the 10 quotes:
1. “If a man has not created wealth. He cannot manage wealth “
2. “Unemployment is worsening. In 2017 our unemployment ratio moved from 14.8% to 18.8% this year. This means that more people have lost their jobs. We can’t survive like this “
3 “You are borrowing money and the issue it was supposed to affect is not coming down. Poverty is increasing, children out of school moved from 10 million to 12 million. “
4. “I remember Ngozi Okonjo Iweala crying every day; begging us to save this money for the rainy day. All the Governors disagreed. They said let us share it. Now we are borrowing to feed.”
5 “All I know is that governance has nothing to do with age. Today, the youngest governor in Nigeria is an unmitigated disaster”
6. “In a State in the North, the number of children that sat for WAEC is 128. This state has about 5 million people. This is not acceptable “
7. “I don’t have any single property in this country outside Onitsha. If you see any property outside Onitsha and they say it belongs to Mr. Peter Obi. Burn it! “
8. “When you are borrowing for consumption. It gets to a stage when you cannot control it”
9. “Nigerians cannot aim for sky scrapers when we cannot maintain simple toilets “
10. “I cannot pay 250,000 for one night in a hotel. I wouldn’t sleep that night. I will feel like I have been robbed. “
