The All Progressives Congress (APC), on Tuesday, denied involvement in the blockade of the National Assembly by masked operatives of the State Security Service (SSS), describing the incident at the National Assembly as purely legislative matter which has nothing to do with the party or the party’s national chairman.
National Daily gathered that  APC in a terse statement indicated that the ruling party is monitoring the situation and has no hand in it.
“Our attention has been drawn to mischievous attempts in some partisan quarters to link Tuesday’s developments in the National Assembly to the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Comrade Adams Oshiomhole.
“While the Party is monitoring the developments in the National Assembly like every other concerned Nigerian and stakeholder, there is absolutely no basis for all the false allegations and attempt to blame the APC National Chairman for the development there. It is strictly a legislative matter,” Yekini Nabena, APC Acting National Publicity Secretary had declared in the statement.
President Muhammadu Buhari is yet to make official statement on the undemocratic action of the SSS which was widely suspected to be done to pave way for APC senators to impeach Senate Prescient Abubakar Bukola Saraki.
Meanwhile, Acting President Yemi Osinbajo had fired SSS DG, Maman Daura.
