Former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar on Thursday took a swipe at President Muhammadu Buhari during a campaign in Enugu, describing the All Progressives Congress (APC) administration as a government of liars.
 Addressing supporters of the Peoples’ Democratic Party in Enugu, Atiku who is seeking the presidential ticket of the party accused the APC administration under Buhari of promising three million jobs which it has not been able to fulfill.
 According to him, since the administration took power in 2015, it has been one problem or the other for Nigerians with many losing their jobs due to the recession brought upon the country by the carelessness of the present administration.
 “This government is a government of liars. They promised three million jobs per annum but Nigeria has been losing three million jobs every year,” he said.
“This job loss has brought the worst form of insecurity in the country. We are facing challenging times in Nigeria. Today, economy is at its lowest ebb and the greatest challenge is unemployment.”
 However, journalists were shut out of the Enugu government house when the former vice-president paid a visit to Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, governor of the state.
 After pleading with the security operatives at the government house, only one journalist was allowed in with Paul Ibe, media aide of Abubakar.
The former vice-president was received by his supporters when he arrived at the Akanu Ibiam International airport and this led to a gridlock.
