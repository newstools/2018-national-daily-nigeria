There comes a time for disagreements, there comes a time for peace and there comes a time for reconciliation. In every hurricane wind, the dusts would always settle.
After close to two months of wrangling in Nigeria’s football controlling body, the NFF, many will want to believe that a lot of lessons have been learnt and corrected.
This  is what i believe will help in charting a new course in the development of Nigerian football. Let us see Monday’s restoration of the much anticipated peace as part of God’s love for the country.
Many may still be nursing pains because the pendulum did not swing in their favour. But, that should not be the case because no matter how we look at it, the disconnection in thoughts had a reason for its emergence and the final outcome was a victory for football and not based on individuality.
Therefore, i enjoin each and everyone to shield the sword and join hands in making our football to attain an enviable height or position that will be the pride of all and sundry.
Meanwhile, let us thank God for safeguarding the life of everyone including my colleagues in the media who were in opposite direction as the leadership tussle lasted.
However, like i promised few days ago, I will not forget to thank the peace builder of our time, the man who no one can undermine but shower encomium for his diligence and style of leadership without bias.
He is no other but Barrister Seyi Akinwunmi, who will continue to remain indelible in the hearts of many because of the positive vibes he has brought into being.
Apart from the major role he played in restoring peace to our football, his humane nature and attention for the down-trodden as well as upliftment of budding talents at the grassroots level are great achievements that will stand the test of time and remain the focal point of assessment of our leaders.
