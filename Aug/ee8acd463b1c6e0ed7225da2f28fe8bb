The 81 Division,  Nigerian Army has set up an investigative panel to look into the circumstances that led to a female soldier resident at Ikeja Cantonment brutalising her niece for allegedly not performing her domestic chores – washing plates.
In a statement by the Acting Deputy Director, 81 Division Army Public Relations, Lieutenant Colonel Monday Daudu on Monday said “The attention of the Headquarters 81 Division Nigerian Army has been drawn to social media reports published on Sunday 19 August 2018 where a female soldier is accused of brutalizing her little niece for allegedly not washing plates.
Describing the incident as “cruel and smack of respect for human dignity which the Nigerian Army totally frowns at” added that the incident was “unfortunate.”
As a result, Lt Col Daudu explained that “an investigation into the matter has been launched by the Nigerian Army Human Rights Desk of 81 Division in conjunction with the National Human Right Commission, South West Zone to ascertain the level of culpability or otherwise of the accused personnel for appropriate sanctions.
It was gathered that the General Officer Commanding (GOC) 81 Division Nigerian Army, Major General Musa Sani Yusuf reassured the general public of its uncompromising professional disposition to all forms of illegitimate acts.
It would be recalled that the female soldiers identified as Ozoekwu Esther Onyinye, from Ebonyi state was said to have flogged daylight out of the girl Nkiruka, for not washing plates.
