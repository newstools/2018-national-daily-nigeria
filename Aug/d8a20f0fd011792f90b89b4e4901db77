The Buhari Media Organisation (BMO) says the presidential ambition of Aminu Tambuwal, governor of Sokoto state, will not come to fruition.
It said on Saturday that the governor will be rejected in the 2019 elections if he either runs for a second term in office or takes a shot at the presidential seat.
The group was reacting to the recent comments credited to the governor in which he claimed Buhari is not medically fit to seek re-election.
Tambuwal had said: “We are aware that the president is affected by serious challenges of health and is being held captive by a cabal that runs Nigeria for their personal interests.”
Responding, BMO said Tambuwal is engaging in a “deliberate campaign of calumny” against the president.
“This infamous style of politics belonged in the past and it is necessary to remind Tambuwal that it is not African tradition for young people to insult their elders and such negative attitude usually had its consequences,” Niyi Akinsiju, chairman of the group, said in a statement.
“We also advise Governor Tambuwal to draw a lesson from what happened to Ayo Fayose in the last Ekiti governorship election, as he was roundly rejected by the electorate due to his non-performance and unguarded utterances.
“We also want to assure Tambuwal that his case will not be different from that of Ayo Fayose, as he will not only be rejected as the next governor of Sokoto state, but his presidential ambition will remain a pipe-dream.
“As he has not only denied his people development but has wasted the scarce resources he ordinarily should have used to render service to the good people of Sokoto state.”
