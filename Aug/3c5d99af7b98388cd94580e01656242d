Murtala Muhammed Airport Area Command of Nigeria Customs Service has intercepted a vehicle belonging to an agency in the aviation industry, said to have been loaded with stolen cargo smuggled from Customs warehouse at the international airport’s tarmac area in Lagos.
The Command also seized military camouflage, walkie-talkie and drones smuggled into the country without end-user certificate from the office of the National Security Adviser, NSA.
Customs Area Controller of the command, Comptroller Jayne Shoboiki, said the suspect arrested in connection with the cargoes, a driver with the agency, sneaked into Customs warehouse at NAHCO shed by 5a.m. and stole the cargoes that had neither been declared nor import duty paid.
Shoboiki said it was shocking to discover that a government agency’s vehicle could be used to smuggle, noting that the suspect was about driving away when he was arrested.
