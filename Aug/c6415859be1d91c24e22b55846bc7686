Linking him with the APC is like linking the governor with armed robbers who stole the mandate of Ekiti people. ‘If it will remain just one man that will continue to stand against the APC tyrannical govt of Buhari, that one man will be Peter Ayodele Fayose.
He remains in PDP. ‘If the dying party, APC is looking for credible people as members that will be available for its final demise, count Fayose out.
‘Governor Fayose remains committed to the task of rescuing Nigeria and its people from the APC and its tyrannical government and no amount of threat, intimidation and blackmail will make him to even consider joining the party, APC.
