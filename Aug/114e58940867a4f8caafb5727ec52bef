Pep Guardiola has hit out at the head of the Argentine Football Association after he claimed the Manchester City boss has a “fat wallet”,National Daily gathered.
Claudio Tapia, the AFA president, claimed this week that he discovered that Guardiola’s salary was unmatchable as he attempted to recruit the Catalan to replace Jorge Sampaoli, who was sacked following Argentina’s disappointing World Cup campaign.
Guardiola, however, has dismissed the claims, insisting that he was never contacted by anybody at the AFA, and that Tapia could not and should not have mentioned his salary.
“So no, I’m a little bit disappointed because the president of the AFA cannot say that he could not be in contact with Pep because his salary is amazing,” the City boss said at his Friday press conference.
“To know that he has to know my salary. Secondly he has to know that I know exactly that when you are with a national team the approach is completely different. And the third thing, the most important, is that nobody contacted me.
