Gabriel Jesus has signed a new two-year deal at Manchester City, extending his contract until at least the summer of 2023,National Daily learnt.
The news will come as a huge boost to Pep Guardiola, after the Brazil star, 21, had requested all talks be held until after this summer’s World Cup.
National Daily learnt that Gabriel  has now committed long-term, putting himself down for at least a five-year stint at the Premier League champions.
Jesus was a key figure for City in 2017-18, as they stormed to a league-cup double, playing 42 times, while scoring 17 goals.
The Brazilian superstar only returned to training the week having returned from his post-World Cup holiday.
He was back at City’s training HQ, alongside Sergio Aguero, as Guardiola got his players ready for this weekend’s Community Shield clash against Chelsea.
Given Jesus has only just returned, it’s unlikely he will start the game against the FA Cup winners at Wembley.
City’s first game of their Premier League title defence comes on August 12 against Arsenal – with Guardiola hopeful of a fully fit squad.
