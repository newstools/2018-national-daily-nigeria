Former President Olusegun Obasanjo has vowed once again that his ex-vice President Atiku Abubakar “can never enjoy” his political support .
“If I support Atiku for anything, God will not forgive me. If I do not know, yes. But once I know, Atiku can never enjoy my support,” he was quoted as saying in a recent interview wih Premium Times.
Atiku has been labouring since 2003 to become president, and his ambition has seen him gp in and out of the PDP no fewer than 3 times on 13 years.
His ambition howevet pitted him against Obasanjo, first in 2003 when Obasanjo had to pristrate for him so the president could get another term, as Nobel Laureate Wole Siyinka said recently.
Since then both politicians have been worst political enemies.
But Obasanjo said he has no personal grudges against Atiku.
He added that his opposition to Atiku’s ambition is only within the political sector and does not translate to other spheres of their lives.
“If my children are getting married, he has sent representatives. If his children are getting married, I have sent representatives. That is social. That is not political,” he said.
“On political ground, my position has not changed. If I support Atiku for a political office other than the one I supported him in the past when I did not know him … God will not forgive me”.
But to work with Atiku in order to oust President Muhammadu Buhari is a no-no.
Obasanjo’s latest outburst is contrary to stories in the media that the two are under pressure to work together in the PDP.
“It is not a question of working with or not working with an individual,” he said in the interview.
“If you are working for the good of Nigeria, I am working with you. If you are not working for the good of Nigeria, it does not matter who you are, I am not working with you.”
