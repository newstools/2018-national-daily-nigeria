The minority leader of the Senate, Godswill Akpabio, has officially dumped the Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP) for the All Progressives Congress (APC).
Akpabio officially defected to the ruling party on Wednesday, August 8 at the Ikot Ekpene township stadium in Akwa Ibom.
National Daily gathered that some of those present at the defection ceremony were the national chairman of the party, Adams Oshiomhole; Senate majority leader, Ahmed Lawan; national leader of the party, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu; and Nigeria’s minister of information and culture, Ahaji Lai Mohammed.
Recall that Akpabio had been associating with the ruling party in the past few days even though he didn’t make his defection official until now.
Meanwhile the defection of Senate minority leader, Chief Godswill Akpabio, to All Progressives Congress (APC) has been described “as the beginning of the end of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP)’.
Chief Eze Chukwuemeka Eze, a chieftain of All Progressives Congress (APC) in Rivers, made the prediction in a statement on Monday, August 6, in Port Harcourt.
Eze, in the statement made available to the newsmen, commended Akpabio “for acting wisely and jumping out of the crashing PDP train before it finally crashes’’.
Also recalled that National Daily had reported the sack of two commissioners in Akwa Ibom state, by the state governor, Emmanuel Udom of Akwa Ibom for frolicking with Goodswill Akpabio.
One of the sacked commissioners, Victor Antai, used to be a former lawmaker in the state, and was until his sack the commissioner in charge of culture and tourism.
 
The other was Ibanga Akpabio, who is a younger brother to Sen. Godswill Akpabio.
