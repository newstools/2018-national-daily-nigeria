Today Chef Ediale Kingsley of National Daily’s Entertainment and Sports desk is back to cooking. Today’s meal, you can almost fix it for free. This vegetable soup is really cheap. it’s the kind of vegetable soup anyone can cook.
I got the vegetables, the amaranth and water leaf from a neighbour’s small garden (so they are FREE).
And the croaker fish is an old left over from the freezer.
Looking at the quantity, five hundred naira should buy this (depends on your market though).
And, if you have to buy the green vegetables, 200 Naira can buy both the green maranth and waterleaf plus 500 Naira fish, 100 Naira crayfish. And you will have yourself an 800 Naira pot of nutrition.
— Fry the onions, pepper, seasoning and fish, add water when you feel the pot is getting dry or about to start burning, when fish is cooked, take it out before adding vegetables else the fish crumbles while stirring.
— Bring back the fish when soup is cooked or just serve it that way.
— For the fresh water leaves, I only cut off the flowers and cooked both the fresh stalk and leaves.
— Take out the fried fishes before adding vegetables.
— Add vegetables to the red pot of fish stock.
— Sprinkle some grinded crayfish for added protein and taste.
Soup is ready. And for most people they enjoy this soup more the next day, after warming. It turns the vegetables brown and this improves the taste.
