Some police officers in Ogun state have allegedly beaten two beautiful women to stupor. It was allegedly that the police officers are attached to Lafenwa Divisonal Police Headquarters in Abeokuta.

According to Faceboook user Dotun Eniku, the women were beaten up by the police officers on their way back from the market.

The Facebook user also claimed that the Deputy Police Officer (DPO) of the division refused to investigate the case and decided to sweep the evidence under the rug by giving the women N3k.

“These two women were beaten and battered by police officers attached to Lafenwa Divisional Police Headquarters, Lafenwa, Abeokuta, Ogun State, Nigeria, recently while coming from the market where they do their buying and selling. The most unfortunate aspect of this dehumanizing acts was that instead of the DPO to investigate the matter and take appropriate actions again the animals among his men, he wanted to sweep the whole thing under the carpet by giving them N3,000 to go and take care of themselves. Some how, the women got in touch with a renounced journalist (name withheld) and the whole issue is now made public.
 
We implore the Ogun State Commissioner of Police, Zonal Commander, Zone 2 and the Inspector General of Police to use their offices to put these police officers to book and get these women good medical care and financial compensation for losses they have incurred as a result of not being able to go to the market for their trading activities since the time this sad and inhuman incident occurred.”
