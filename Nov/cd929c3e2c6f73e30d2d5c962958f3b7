New Inter director Beppe Marotta could beat Juventus to Paul Pogba by offering Milan Skriniar or Ivan Perisic to Manchester United, claim Tuttosport.
The remarkable assertion is the front page story in today’s edition of the Turin-based newspaper.
Marotta was pushed out of Juve after seven consecutive Serie A titles, with his assistant Fabio Paratici promoted to general manager on Friday.
Although Inter have not yet formally announced Marotta, it is only a matter of days before he is appointed to Juve’s Serie A rivals and he might already have some big plans.
According to Tuttosport, he intends to hijack Juve’s bid to bring Pogba back to Serie A by counting on Jose Mourinho’s strong interest in two Nerazzurri stars.
It is no secret that Manchester United are desperate to sign winger Perisic and centre-back Skriniar, with massive price-tags placed on them.
If Inter were to include them in any kind of deal for Pogba, Juve would struggle to compete with that proposal.
However, France international Pogba has spoken repeatedly of Juventus and Turin being his “home” in Italy and probably would not accept a different club.
