The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) sent out strong warning to Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, national leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), not to reduce his pedigree to hate speech and smear campaign in expressing his opinion on the PDP presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, or the Opposition Political Party.
National Daily gathered PDP admonished that as a political elder, Tinubu should not reduce his pedigree by engaging in indecorous utterances which has become the trademark of his dysfunctional ruling party.
“It is also instructive to state that a person of Asiwaju status can conduct his political activities without recourse to indecent language that is lacking in respect for a personality, such as Atiku, whom Nigerians, across board, have generally resolved to be their next President.
“For the avoidance of doubt, despite the ludicrous disposition of APC and its leaders towards the 2019 election campaign, the repositioned PDP and our presidential candidate remain committed to our promise to focus on solutions to the myriad of problems facing our people and transform their lives for the better.
“The PDP, therefore, cautions Tinubu to redirect the discourse of his party to productive issues instead of this unbridled resort to lies, deception, beguilement, propaganda, smear campaign and uncouth language, which Nigerians now resent.”
National Daily learnt that Tinubu had during his visit to Presdient Muhammadu Buhari at the State House, Aso Rock, Abuja on Wednesday, told State House Correspondents that whether Atike and PDP leaders visited Dubai or the jungle for strategy meeting, the country would not go back “to the illusion of the PDP” which had misruled Nigeria for 16 years.
He had maintained that APC is not jittery over the shift of strategic meeting to Dubai where Atiku has been on holidays after the PDP National Convention.
