Jurgen Klopp has dismissed claims that Liverpool’s season will only be a success if they win their first-ever Premier League title.
Liverpool have made their best start to a Premier League campaign but are two points behind champions Manchester City.
Klopp’s side are unbeaten in the league after 11 games but have won only three of their last nine matches in all competitions following Tuesday’s Champions League defeat at Red Star Belgrade.
“It’s a very positive situation,” the manager, whose side face struggling Fulham on Sunday, told a news conference on Friday. “The season so far, points-wise, the Premier League season, is really successful.
“But it doesn’t really feel like that because of two reasons. The comparison with last year, the free-flowing football in a few games, and Man City, Chelsea and few others play a very good season. That should not be a surprise for us, so it isn’t.
“Always you see we struggle and they win 6-0. Even if it’s not Premier League, it’s kind of this big gap.
“It feels a bit like this season can only be a success in the moment — from how I feel it from all the questions I got asked after games and around games — if we become champions in a year where our competitors are the champions of last year, the champions of two years ago [Chelsea], a refreshed Arsenal and a more experienced Tottenham and Man United.
“That’s a really tough job, and we have no problem with that. We go for everything. We have to build on our situation, get better, get confidence.
“It’s all OK, but this game on Tuesday was this kind of massive knock that was not expected. Now we have to react in the right way — not only on Sunday, but in general.”
Klopp said Jordan Henderson, Naby Keita and Joe Gomez will all be available for selection against Fulham on Sunday.
