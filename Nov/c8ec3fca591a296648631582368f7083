PSG midfielder Marco Verratti has been arrested on suspicion of drink driving, it has been claimed in France.
The Italian international was pulled over in the early hour of Wednesday morning, respected French newspaper L’Equipe report.
It is suggested he was twice the legal drink drive limit. He or his club are yet to comment.
L’Equipe say Verratti was placed in a ‘sobering cell’ before being able to leave station.
The midfielder, 25, was arrested on a Paris ringroad, a police source suggests.
French champions PSG face Lille on Friday and and it is unclear if the 27-time capped Italy star he will be involved in the Ligue 1 match.
The news comes after Tottenham and France goalkeeper Hugo Lloris was banned from being behind the wheel having been ‘completely drunk’ while driving his Porsche.
He was fined £50,000 after pleading guilty to being more than two times over the drink-drive limit on August 24.
The World Cup winner, 31, was “lucky” not to knock down pedestrians or damage cars after being “showered with drinks” at a restaurant, a court heard in September.
