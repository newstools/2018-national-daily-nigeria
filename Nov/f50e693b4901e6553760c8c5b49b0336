Watford striker Isaac Success has been rated the best Nigerian player in Europe’s top five leagues for the month of October 2018 according to International Centre for Sports Studies,National Daily gathered.


CIES Football Observatory has rated players on a match-by-match basis by taking into account the pitch production and efficiency at both individual and collective level, and the Hornets number 10 was the highest ranked Nigerian star after finishing 243rd among the 931 players representing Premier League, Bundesliga, Serie A, La Liga and Ligue 1 clubs ranked.

National Daily learnt that of the three matches played by Watford in the Premier League in October, Success, who was rated 78.3, started two games against Wolves and Huddersfield and was on target against the Terriers in a 3-0 win.

Unsurprisingly, the second best rated Nigerian star is Chelsea loanee Kenneth Omeruo at 328th position and with a 75.8 rating.

The Leganes defender has become a mainstay in the starting line-up largely due to his impressive performances.

In third position is another Chelsea loanee in the shape of Ola Aina (396th, 74.0), followed by Leicester City midfielder Wilfred Ndidi (411st, 73.8).

Udinese’s William Troost Ekong and Arsenal’s Alex Iwobi complete the top six Nigerian stars in the rankings.
