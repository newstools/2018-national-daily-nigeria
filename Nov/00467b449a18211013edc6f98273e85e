Senator Shehu Sani, representing Kaduna Central senatorial district in the National Assembly has expressed his disappointment with his colleagues at the Senate over their decision to suspend implementation of the proposed 500 per cent hike excise tariff on alcoholic beverages and tobacco products.
It would be recall that Nigeria Government approved the increase in March and the then Finance minister, Kemi Adeosun said the upward review of the excise duty rates for alcoholic beverages and tobacco was to achieve a dual benefit of raising the Government’s fiscal revenues and reducing the health hazards associated with tobacco-related diseases and alcohol abuse.
But the senate on Tuesday directed the Nigerian Government to suspend the implementation of the proposed 500 per cent hike. The house, however, advised that a tariff hike of not more than 50 per cent should be adopted in order to boost Nigeria revenue generation.
However, in a tweet on Wednesday, Senator Sani expressed his support for the 500% hike on imported alcohol beverages and tobacco products, saying they luxuries and not necessities.
According to industry figures, Nigeria consumes 12.28 litres of alcohol a year per head.
