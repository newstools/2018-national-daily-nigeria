The Presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, arrived Enugu, Enugu State on Wednesday for a crucial meeting with PDP leaders in the South East. The meeting was a promise Atiku made after he selected former governor of Anambra State, Peter Obi, as his running mate but quickly proceeded on vacation to Dubai, United Arab Emirate after the PDP National Convention in Port Harcourt, Rivers, State.
South East leaders in the PDP had protested that they were not consulted by Atiku before the choice of Peter Obi as the Vice Presidential candidate of the party from the zone. The protest led to a meeting of the party leaders in the zone where they expressed their resentment.
However, Atiku being proactive, sent a message to the meeting, promising that he would meet with them on return from his vacation overseas. He sooth their nerves that they were not undermined in the choice of Obi.
The meeting this Wednesday would resolve the Obi issue, among others.
Details later.
