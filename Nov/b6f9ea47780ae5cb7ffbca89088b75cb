Super Falcons coach Thomas Dernneby has blamed lack of good friendlies as one of the reasons to the team’s loss to South Africa as he hails the Bayana Bayana’s team.
The Swedish coach spoke of the activeness of South Africa and also the development of Female football in Africa.
” I can see it with my own eyes what’s happening in this continent, a lot of teams have improved, also know that South Africa have prepared the team very well,  also lot of friendlies this year, we know it’s a good team.”
“We have a very strong team, time is good for us, the more we be together the more we play together, everybody knows we didn’t have the best of friendlies but our aim is still there which is to win the trophy and qualify for the World Cup.”
The Super Falcons will hope to bounce back in their second game against table toppers Zambia who trashed Equatorial Guinea 5-0 on Wednesday.
