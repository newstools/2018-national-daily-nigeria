Presidential aspirant of the Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar, on Sunday alleged that he was searched by state security agents upon his return to Nigeria.
The former Vice President has been in Dubai for some weeks now strategising on how to capture power from the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and President Muhammadu Buhari comes 2019.
While in Dubai, Atiku held a lot of meetings with his associates, including some senators and governors. Pictures of these meetings were posted in the social media.
Tweeting on his handle on Sunday, Atiku said that immediately his plane landed at the Nnamdi Azikwe International Airport in Abuja, it was surrounded by a team of security officials who searched the plane and the staff.
Atiku said the search was aimed at intimidating him and his staff. He said that he remained committed to building a Nigeria where no citizen is intimidated by agents of state who are paid to protect them.
Meanwhile Senator Ben Murray-Bruce has condemned the harassment of Atiku by security agents.
His tweet reads: I totally condemn this reckless harassment of @atiku the candidate of the @OfficialPDPNig as he landed in Abuja. Nigeria is not a fascist state. We will not return to a jackboot dictatorship. This government should face Atiku at the polls, not with force
