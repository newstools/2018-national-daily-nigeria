Female Muslim students in Lagos public schools are now free to wear hijabs.
The Lagos State Government approved this in a circular issued on Wednesday.
Former Lagos Gov. Raji Fashola opposed the wearing of hijabs when it was moved by the Muslim Students Society of Nigeria during his tenure.
The debate escalated and ended up in court, and has yet to be resolved up till now.
“Since the case of the use of Hijab in Lagos State is still pending in the Supreme court of Nigeria, status quo be maintained, to avoid contempt of the court, that is students be allowed to wear Hijabs on school uniforms but same must be short, smart, neat and in the same colour of the uniform (skirt),” the circular read in part.
Sharing the circular, the MSSN commended the government decision, saying it would stop harassment of female Muslims students in public school.
The University of Ibadan Secondary School, in Oyo state, was shut down recently to avoid crisis following the sudden appearance of female students in hijab.
According to the school authorities, a clique among the parents decided to press for the rights of their children in the private school.
