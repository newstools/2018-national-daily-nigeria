Nike and Barcelona FC have teamed up for a special edition 20-year anniversary jersey. The shirt celebrates Barcelona and Nike’s long history working together and is on the way soon.
According to Nike’s press release, the jersey features a “stylish mash-up of every home shirt of the last two decades”.
“This idea really came out of the blue,” said Nike’s Pete Hoppins.
“We wanted to do something different to celebrate the 20th anniversary. The main challenge was ensuring all the previous shirts were represented, but also that each one was carefully placed.
“We had to be mindful of the overall design, rather than just placing each one anywhere on the garment.”
