The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has dispelled insinuations of an impending petroleum products scarcity in the country.
A release on Sunday by the NNPC Group General Manager, Group Public Affairs, Mr. Ndu Ughamadu, said the corporation had 39 days petroleum products sufficiency and about 25 days products availability on land, stressing that motorists and other consumers of petroleum products are assured of adequate stock to meet their energy needs.
The NNPC spokesperson said while providing information on the petroleum products stock level became necessary to dispel suggestions that the threat of strike action by the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) would result in a slip into a round of products shortages across the country.
Ughamadu advised motorists not to engage in panic buying as the corporation would do all it could to ensure the strike action does not impact negatively on fuel distribution nationwide.
He stated that Nigerians should remain vigilant and volunteer information to the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR), the Industry regulator or to any law enforcement agency around them, on any station that attempts to take advantage of any prevailing situation in the country at the expense of the consumers.
