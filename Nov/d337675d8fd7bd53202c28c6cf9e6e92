The latest round of Football Leaks reports dropped on Friday, accusing both Premier League champions Manchester City and Ligue 1 champions Paris Saint-Germain of fraud to avoid financial fair play sanctions.
FIFA President Gianni Infantino, former UEFA President Michel Platini and even former French President Nicolas Sarkozy were all named in the reports, as per Mediapart,National Daily learnt.
German outlet Der Spiegel expanded on the reports, publishing a damning article on Infantino. The 48-year-old was named FIFA President in 2016 with the explicit task of cleaning up the organisation, but according to “thousands of internal memos” he has allegedly done the exact opposite.
The report goes on to detail how he allegedly “cut secret deals” with City and PSG in 2014 while he was still UEFA’s general secretary. Those deals reportedly allowed the clubs to circumvent financial fair play regulations and play European football.
National Daily gathered that Infantino allegedly went out of his way to ensure PSG and City avoided major punishment, proposing “compromises” and even “supplying them with confidential materials.”
The report outlines how Infantino tried to go against the Club Financial Control Body, eventually succeeding with the help of Platini.
Der Spiegel’s reporting also included a section on the long-rumoured European superleague, stating several elite clubs have already been hard at work on such a competition
