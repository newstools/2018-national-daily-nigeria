The APC National Working Committee APC has adopted Sen. Hope Uzodinma as the governorship candidate of the party for Imo .
The party decided Wednesday in Abuja, and the senator’s name will be forwarded to INEC before the Nov 2 deadline.
Gov. Richaas Okorocha had worked triedlessly to instal his son-in-law Uche Nwosu by muscling out Deputy-Governor Madummere, and fighting off Uzodinma who also contested the primary.
A kangaroo primary eventually produced Nwosu as the APC governorship candidate.
This pitted Okorocha against the NWC, who had earlier advised him to cede 45 percent of the party structure to Uzodinma—and choose between his Senate ticket and Nwosu’s guber ambition.
The governor wants to go to Senate, and also impose his son-in-law as governor—because it is only the two of them, he explained, that can win election on APC’s platform.
Okorocha is one of the closest to President Muhammadu Buhari, but he might fallen out of favour in the Villa as a result of this.
