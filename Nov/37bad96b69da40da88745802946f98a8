The peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP), Lagos state chapter says Babajide Sanwo-Olu, governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) is a ‘bad market’ that cannot appeal to Lagosians even if he buys political parties beyond the registered ones in the country.
Publicity Secretary of party in Lagos, Barrister Taofik Gani, disclosed this on Sunday while reacting to the news that 45 opposition parties at the weekend formed a coalition and endorsed Sanwo-Olu as their candidate for the governorship election.
According to the PDP, the hurried and controversial emergence of the APC candidate is an indelible political albatross.
“Indeed the emergence is tainted with desperation to have someone as governor who will rather fund the APC leaders. Lagosians will not forget that this is the Lagos APC reason for dropping Governor Ambode.
“To us, the consequence of the Sanwo-Olu imposition is the terminal acrimony, defections and anti-party in the Lagos APC, which we shall duly capitalise on to end the reign of APC in Lagos state,” he said.
The PDP further described Sanwo-Olu as an emergency candidate who is unprepared for the job compared to the PDP candidate, Jimi Agbaje, whose blueprint to free Lagos has been on since 2006.
The party also promised to expose the APC governorship candidate “as truly not fit and proper to govern the state”.
“At the appropriate time, we shall expose Sanwo-Olu as truly not fit and proper to be elected governor of Lagos State,” the party said.
