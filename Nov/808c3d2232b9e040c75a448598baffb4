Kano Gov. Abdullahi Ganduje will on Friday receive the Africa Value Award for “effective leadership and economic empowerment”.
Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo will grace the ceremony in Abuja as the special guest of honor.
The organisers of the award said it was established to recognise African citizens and also honour governors, legislators, captains of industries and other esteemed Africans in various fields of endeavors.
According to them, the Ganduje-led administration has been able to make significant strides towards implementing development agenda that will make Kano citizens enjoy the dividends of change.
“Not only that, development programmes are evenly spread across the state in terms of infrastructure development in the areas of road construction/rehabilitation, education, health, water supply, environmental protection, agriculture, economy etc,” said the organisers.
Ganduje has been embroiled in a bribery scandal the state’s lawmakers are probing currently.
A series of video clips recently published by the Daily Nigerian, showed the governor stuffing in his clothes hard currencies allegedly collected as kickbacks from contractors.
The governor has denied this, suing the publisher Jafaar Jafaar with N3bn for defamation.
Others slated to receive the awards are Adeyeye Ogunwusi, the ooni of Ife (African traditional ICON of the year), Ifie Sekibo, chief executive officer of Heritage bank, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, former president of Liberia, Arthur Eze, chairman of Atlas Petroleum International Limited, Babatunde Fowler,chairman of Federal Inland Revenue Services (FIRS).
