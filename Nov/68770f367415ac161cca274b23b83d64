Here are the common chemicals in body soap that can cause the following health risks:
1. Benzaldehyde: Depresses the nervous system, brings on dizziness, vomiting, and sudden drops in blood pressure if inhaled.
2. Benzyl Acetate: Eye and lung irritant, and known carcinogen that has been associated with pancreatic cancer.
3. Sodium Laureth Sulfate (SLS): Breaks down fats, and impairs the skins ability to maintain moisture. Classified as a “mutagen” meaning it can alter genetic material in cells.
4. Ethanol: On the EPA’s hazardous waste list! Can irritate the respiratory tract and cause vision impairments and loss of muscle control.
5. Linalool: Narcotic substance that can harm your respiratory system and motor activity. Can also attract bees, which would be a problem for those of you allergic to bees.
Again, this is just a short list to give you an idea. The good news is, you have plenty of healthy natural soaps to choose from!
Here are some tips for picking the best body soaps:
Feed your skin the best natural ingredients with body soaps that matches your skin type.
Look for natural soaps with organic herb, or plant based ingredients. They should contain pure essential oils, olive, palm or coconut oils as a base.
Natural soaps are also better for our planet because they don’t harm the environment after they go down the drain.
