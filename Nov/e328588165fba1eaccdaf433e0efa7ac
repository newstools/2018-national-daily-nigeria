The Frenchman spoke to media ahead of PAOK game. Giroud says the squad learned their lesson in Tottenham loss.
The team is eager to bounce back in Europa League and the next fixtures
Olivier Giroud spoke to the media ahead of PAOK game in the Europa League. The Frenchman insists that the Chelsea game the fans had to see against Tottenham was an exception. The Blues are ready to bounce back after the poor performance:
“Everybody was aware of the poor performance and we just want to make it right for the next game. It was not the Chelsea we are used to seeing this season. The manager was not happy at all with our performance. Even though it’s our first defeat of the season, it’s been hard to accept.
“We want to bounce back as soon as possible and we want to do it tomorrow in the Europa League, and after at the weekend against Fulham
The striker explains the Sarri’s philosophy once again and says that the squad understands it and relates to it very well:
“It’s all about following the ball, pressing high, covering the ball, being compact. We didn’t do that against Tottenham, so we need to come back to the main principles.
“The message of the coach is quite clear: commitment, application, and after that doing the right things on the pitch. We are not far away from what he wants us to do.
“You can always improve yourselves. The message is clear. It’s not because we lost we have to question whether we are ready or the manager’s philosophy.”
