Following the expiration of the November 17 deadline given to candidates by the National Examination Council (NECO) for the 2018 November/December Senior Secondary School Certificate Examination (SSCE), the body has introduced walk-in registration for late candidates.
Announcing this on Tuesday, Acting Registrar of NECO, Abubakar Gana said applicants wishing to sit for the examination could still register as walk-in candidates.
The Registrar said the extension became necessary because some of the candidates could not register at the expiration of registration deadline of Nov. 17.
He advised all the candidates who failed to meet the registration deadline to take advantage of the window provided by the management.
The NECO boss urged candidates registering after the closing date to adhere to the guidelines of the registration process.
He, however, warned that such candidates must complete the registration within twenty-four hours to the scheduled time of examination for the subject(s) that they intended to sit for.
Gana also advised those who wish to register as walk-in candidates to contact the nearest NECO State Office for full details on the registration procedure.
It would be recalled that NECO had on Nov. 14 announced a change in its examination date from Nov. 15 to Nov. 19.
NECO said the changes were necessary to ensure that no candidate missed the examination and for the council to ensure a successful conduct of its examinations.
