AC Milan striker Gonzalo Higuain is reportedly open to the idea of joining Chelsea.
The Blues were linked with a move for the Argentina international during the summer, but Higuain instead joined Milan on a two-year loan deal from Juventus as part of an exchange which also took Mattia Caldara to the San Siro while Leonardo Bonucci moved in the opposite direction.
 
Higuain has scored seven goals in 13 appearances for the Rossoneri so far, but Corriere dello Sport claims that he is eager to move to the Premier League.
The 30-year-old is reportedly waiting for Maurizio Sarri to make his move as Chelsea consider reviving their interest as early as the January transfer window.
Chelsea are thought to be in the market for a new striker due to ongoing reservations over the ability of Alvaro Morata and Olivier Giroud to lead them to a sustained title challenge.
Any deal would require Chelsea to come to an agreement with both Milan and Higuain’s parent club Juventus, though.
