The Zenith Labour Party flagbearer and Ondo former Gov. Olusegun Mimiko has trashed his lofty ambition of presidency for the Ondo central senatorial ticket.
He’s now joining forces with the PDP.
One of his former commissioners had clinched the senatorial ticket and was listed by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) as ZLP’s candidate in the election.
But Gboye Adegbenro was said to have traded the ticket with Mimiko, according to sources.
“Oga (Mimiko) is now the senatorial candidate of ZLP. He is not contesting for president again,” The Cable quoted a source.
“Adegbenro is his boy, he has already stepped down for him.”
The source added that ZLP has reached an agreement with the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for the presidential election.
“ZLP is having an agreement with PDP in the presidential election, so we are no more fielding any candidate,” the source said.
