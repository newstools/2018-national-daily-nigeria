A Karmo Grade I Area Court in Abuja on Wednesday sentenced one Stephen Musa to three months’ imprisonment for stealing a police officer’s television, phones and laptops valued at N1.5m.
Magistrate Inuwa Maiwada, however, gave the convict an option to pay a fine of N11,000.
Musa, who has no fixed address, was arraigned on three counts bordering on house breaking, theft and mischief, to which he pleaded guilty.
Earlier, the prosecutor counsel, Mrs. Ijeoma Ukagha, had told the court that the convict, on September 25, at 11:45p.m., broke into the house of ASP Musa Maina but was arrested.
Ukagha said that during Police investigation, the convict confessed that he broke into the same house in August and made away with a television, phones and laptops.
She added that Musa also confessed to have stolen four generators and buckets.
She also said that the convict confessed that he had been arrested for stealing.
The offences contravene the provisions of sections 346, 287 and 327 of the Penal Code.
