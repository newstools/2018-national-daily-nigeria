“It is a great pride for me to win the first important title with Atleti and the World Cup. It could not be better, “said the Atlético de Madrid player. On the Golden Ball, which will be announced on the next day 3, Griezmann said that “makes dream”, but denied having information about the winner despite the fact that the vote has already been closed.
The Frenchman confessed to having spoken with Luis Suárez, who will be his rival next Saturday. “It will be a very nice game, not a key one, because there are many games left, but a nice match for us, the fans and the clubs.”
