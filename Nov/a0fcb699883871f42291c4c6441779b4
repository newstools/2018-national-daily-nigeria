Cristiano Ronaldo has become the first man to 100 Champions League wins, with the Juventus superstar reaching that mark against Valencia.
National Daily learnt that records continue to tumble around the Portuguese as the bar of individual excellence is raised in each passing campaign.
Ronaldo was not among the goals in his most recent outing, but he still made a telling contribution in a 1-0 victory for the Serie A champions.
It was his cross that allowed Mario Mandzukic to record the only effort of the game, with a narrow success enough to carry Juve into the last 16.
Their talismanic No. 7 is now one step closer to capturing the sixth continental crown of his remarkable career.
He has previously lifted the trophy with Manchester United and on four occasions with Real Madrid.
When taking that haul into account, it should come as no surprise to find that he has become the first player to hit a century of wins in the competition.
