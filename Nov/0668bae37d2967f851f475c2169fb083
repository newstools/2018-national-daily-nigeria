Shuts out Christians from State




Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State has commenced Islamisation policy in Kaduna State, thus, erasing the Muslim/Christian dichotomy in the formation of government. El-Rufai, in thet preparations for the 2019 general elections, shuts out Christians in Kaduna State in his choice of a fellow Muslim to present Muslim/Muslim joint ticket to the voting population in the state. Accordingly, Governor El-Rufai, having picked the governorship ticket for 2019, picked Dr. Hadiza Balarabe, a Muslim, as his running mate. The governor argued that he chose Balarabe for the deputy governorship thicket because she is the right person for the job.
National Daily gathered that El-Rufai, receiving delegates from Sanga Local Government Area on Tuesday, declared that “Muslim-Muslim ticket is not a religious ticket but a competence and performance ticket.”
However, the decision has continued to generate crisis in Kaduna State. Several stakeholders in the state, including Sheikh Gumi, have declared that Muslim/Muslim governorship ticket is not acceptable in Kaduna State, vowing to resist the decision.
