The national vice chairman (northwest) of the ruling APC has been expelled in Sokoto following a petition by a party man.
Inuwa Abdulkadir was fired for alleged anti-party activities listed in a petition by Naibi Abubakar, who comes from the same Magajin Maigari Ward as Abdulkadir.
The petitioner who identified himself as a bonafide member of the APC with registration number SOK/SON/04006510 said since he was elected, the vice chairman “did not convene any zonal meeting of the APC m and he never attended one.
The vice chairman was also said to hiave distanced himself from the primary elections in the state—and even on the direct primary that produced President Muhammadu Buhari.
A committee was set up following the petition, and in its report submiited by committee chair Shamsu Bello, the panel recommended Abdulkadir be dismissed.
The APC headquarters,however, have reacted, saying the lower chapter cannot sack a national executive.
