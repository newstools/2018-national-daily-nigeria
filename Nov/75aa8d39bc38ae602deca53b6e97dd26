Would you know what to do if a player “swallowed their tongue”?! Indeed, can a player actually swallow their tongue? Find out more with the new poster created by FIFA Medical on “what to do when a player’s tongue obstructs their airway”.
A similar poster on sudden cardiac arrests was launched during the 2018 FIFA World Cup™. Addressing key aspects of football emergency medicine and featuring the same look and feel, both posters serve as quick and easy, step-by-step guides on how to react and potentially save a life.
The posters are available to download at https://www.fifa.com/medical in the four FIFA languages: English, French, German and Spanish. Guidance on dealing with airway obstructions can be found on this poster.
