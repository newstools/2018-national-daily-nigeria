Speaking with journalists, NANS president, Danielson Akpan, said the the dwindling allocation of funding to the sector is worrisome.
“The funding keeps dropping every year,” Akpan said during the rally entitled “Save Education Rally.”
The head of International Relations department at the NLC said much attention is not given to the education sector.
According to him, the major reason for the ongoing ASUU strike is poor funding of the sector.
ASUU has been on strike for about two weeks.
They are protesting poor funding for the sector and non-implementation of the 2009 agreement with the federal government among others.
