Oghenekaro Etebo, a Nigerian footballer who played against Lionel Messi at the recently concluded 2018 FIFA World Cup explained why he preferred the Argentina star over Portugal great Cristiano Ronaldo.
The Stoke City and Super Eagles midfielder heaped praises on football greats – Messi and Ronaldo – for their dominance in the past decade. However, Etebo also accepted that he thought FC Barcelona superstar Messi was “the better of the two”.
“They are both top players but I must tell you the truth, you can imagine that in 10 years it’s been both of them staying consistent for that long,” Oghenekaro Etebo, said, before adding, “I don’t think it has ever happened before in football. These two rivals are so good and untouchable, but I’m going to go for Lionel Messi as the better of the two.”
Further explaining his point, Oghenekaro Etebo said Ronaldo is very hard working and he admires him but Messi is just magical.
“Ronaldo is a very hardworking player that shows you that with the dedication to what you do, you can reach the top of your craft,” he said. “I honestly admire him as well, but Messi is just magical.”
Though Etebo has never faced Juventus striker Cristiano Ronaldo, he played against Argentina star Messi at the World Cup in Russia.
