CD Leganes and Super Eagles defender, Kenneth Omeruo who is presently in the camp of the Super Eagles in Johannesburg revealed about the opportunity to play in  the Spanish top flight.
He said, “Playing in the Spanish La-Liga is quite huge, an opportunity I had always longed for and eventually when it came i grab it with my both hands.”
Omeruo said he had to turn down several offers before deciding to settle for Leganes because of the opportunity to play in one of the best leagues in the World.
On how life has been at his new club, he said, “I am actually enjoying my game at the moment. Four straight games is quite impressive for me and with our last match ending in a barren draw was good for our confidence as we look to remain in the Spanish Elite League.”
Super Eagles defender added that he was at the moment totally focused on getting a result with the Super Eagles against the Bafana Bafana and would be eager to play if given an opportunity as he is always on looking for a chance to represent his fatherland.
The Super Eagles are looking to avenge the defeat earlier in the qualifiers when Bafana Bafana pick up all three points, defeating the Super Eagles by a 2-0 margin in Uyo.
