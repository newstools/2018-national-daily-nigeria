The 26-year-old is confident his fellow Brazil international will have a tough time against an in-form defence when they meet at Parc des Princes.
Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson has backed his team’s defence to put up a good fight against Neymar when they face Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League on Wednesday.
The Premier League side travel to the French capital looking to enhance their chances of progressing to the knockout rounds of the competition.
Liverpool and Napoli occupy the top two spots in Group C after four matches but PSG are just one point behind, with bottom side Red Star Belgrade a further point back.
The Reds will be out of reach for PSG if they manage to get the three points from their penultimate group stage game, but that is no easy task with Neymar, Kylian Mbappe and Edinson Cavani leading the opponents’ attack.
However, Alisson is confident his side can keep PSG’s forward line quiet and expects to be in good form himself to help the cause.
“They have Neymar against our defenders but we have also a great defence so it’ll be a great match for everybody to see,” National daily understands.
“I’m expecting to have a great match in this game too.”
Alisson has quickly become a big hit among the Liverpool faithful since joining from Roma in the summer.
As the Reds sit second in the Premier League and are hoping to land silverware this season, the 26-year-old feels he is settling in well at Anfield.
“I am getting used to the team, my colleagues and the culture,” he said. “I’m really happy with my moment right now with the team and the national squad.”
