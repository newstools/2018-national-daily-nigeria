Real Madrid have reportedly given up in their pursuit of Juventus striker Paulo Dybala.
Dybala is understood to have been included as one of the names on Madrid’s wish list of potential candidates to replace Cristiano Ronaldo following his move to Turin during the summer.
However, Calciomercato reports that Los Blancos have now decided to focus on other targets after conceding that Dybala would cost too much money to prise away from Juve.
Madrid would still like to bring the Argentine to the Bernabeu, but will now prioritise the signing of Neymar from Paris Saint-Germain following reports that the Brazilian could instead return to Barcelona.
Dybala has scored six goals in 14 appearances for Juventus so far this season, but only two of those goals have come in the league.
Other names on Madrid’s list of possible Ronaldo replacements are also thought to include Eden Hazard, Mohamed Salah and Harry Kane.
