The Minister of Youth and Sports Barrister Solomon Dalung has congratulated the Super Eagles for their early qualification for the Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon next year.
The men’s senior national football team drew 1-1 away to Bafana Bafana of South Africa on Saturday at the FNB Stadium to top group E with 10 points and join host- Cameroon, Madagascar, Senegal, Tunisia, Egypt, Morocco and Uganda as early arrivals in Cameroon.
Barrister Dalung commended the efforts of the players enjoining them to reinforce their dominance as one of the best footballing nations in Africa.
“I congratulate the Super Eagles for their commitment, hard work and discipline which brought about their  emphatic win.
“Having clinched the AFCON ticket with a game to go, I urge you not to relent in your efforts and to begin preparations in earnest for the Cup of Nations in Cameroon”.
Nigeria had failed  back to back in two previous attempts in 2015 and 2017 to qualify for the Africa Cup of Nations but made it this time following Federal government’s intervention and investment  in sports.
The Federal Ministry of Youth and Sports’ policy of prioritizing athletes, footballers and officials’ welfare also played a vital role in the Super Eagles’ qualification for the Africa Cup of Nations.
Barrister Dalung had also advised all National Sports Federations to ensure that government’s  investment is properly utilized on this policy directive.
The Super Eagles next game is in 2019 against Seychelles
