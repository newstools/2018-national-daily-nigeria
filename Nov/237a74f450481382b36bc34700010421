This is not the best of time for the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole as various allegations continue to tail his chairmanship of the ruling party.
Less than a month after being interrogated by the DSS over allegation of bribery by some high profile members of the party, Babatunde Ogala, national legal adviser of the party, has also accused Adams Oshiomhole of hijacking his office.
In an internal memo dated November 6, Ogala accused the national chairman of starving his office of funds since he became the party’s legal adviser on June 25.
He alleged that Oshiomhole had sidelined him and refused to consult him over issues his office are supposed to handle.
“I am constrained to put this memo and complaint in writing in the light of the repeated acts of usurpation and deliberate encroachment on my office and attempt to undermine my person,” Ogala said.
He said the chairman on an earlier occasion had apologized to him after he protested the encroachment into his office.
The legal adviser said the latest attempt to usurp his office was a move by Oshiomhole using Ibrahim Masari, national welfare secretary.
The latest crisis is coming three months to the general election and at a time the ruling party ought to be focused on the campaigns which kicked off on Sunday in line with the schedule of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).
