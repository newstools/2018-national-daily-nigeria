Ajax always produce top end talents as Frankie De Jong and Matthjis De Ligt have been turning heads. Both players have been doing incredibly well for the Dutch club as many big European clubs have been after them of late. Ronald De Boer (who played for Ajax and Barcelona) spoke to Fox Sport (via IlBianconero), here is what he had to say on the matter:

“De Ligt and De Jong? They are two great young players. I think that they should sign with either FC Barcelona or Manchester City. I feel like Ajax style of play is similar to Barcelona’s so this would surely help them adapt. I know that I played for Barca so I might not be neutral but I think that they are an ideal team for any young player. Money?

Let’s see how it goes…”. Let’s not forget that Juve are also interested…
