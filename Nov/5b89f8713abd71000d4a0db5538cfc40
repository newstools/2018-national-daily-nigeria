Harry Kane is convinced that surpassing Wayne Rooney’s record haul of 53 England goals is “definitely possible” for him, though he admits it is a long ways away. .

Rooney’s international career came to a close on Thursday in a friendly against the United States, with the former Manchester United striker honoured.

He was unable to add to his tally in the 3-0 win at Wembley, however, and tipped Kane to one day go past him.

Tottenham star Kane has netted 19 times in 34 outings for his country, and having been named captain, looks set to have the central striker’s position nailed down for the foreseeable future.

Kane insists he is not looking too far into the future, though he is confident he can topple Rooney’s record.

“It’s definitely possible, but it’s a fair bit away,” Kane told reporters at England’s pre-match news conference ahead of facing Croatia in the Nations League on Sunday.

“I don’t like to set targets that far ahead because a lot can happen, we’ll see over the next few years.

“Hopefully I’ll still be fit and healthy and still getting picked by the manager. It’s definitely achievable, but I’m not thinking too much about it.”
