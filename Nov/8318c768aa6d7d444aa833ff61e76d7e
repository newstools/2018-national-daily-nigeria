Raheem Sterling has signed a three-year contract extension with Manchester City, the club have announced.
Sterling is now tied to the club until 2023 after agreeing a lucrative new deal that could earn him as much as £300,000 per week.
City had been trying to renew the England international’s contract since last season but only reached a break through in the past few weeks.
The 23-year-old had been linked with a move to Real Madrid but has now committed his future to City for the next five years.
“I’m delighted to sign,” Sterling said in a club release. “My development here has been incredible. I felt from the minute I got here it was the right choice for me. It’s really paid off for me and I’m really grateful.
“Every season you come in you want to do better than your previous season. You want to try and develop and get better.
“With the facilities we’ve got here there’s no reason not to. With the coaching staff and the players we have in this team it’s the perfect environment to develop and get better.”
Sterling is in his fourth season with City after joining the club from Liverpool in 2015.
