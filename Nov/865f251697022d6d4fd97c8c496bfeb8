The British government on Thursday renewed its warning on the Nigerian Government and the Shi’ite Muslims over the perennial violence in the Federal Capital territory, Abuja, as the Islamic Movement of Nigeria members engage the Nigerian military and Police in violent confrontations in the protests for the release of IMN leader, Sheikh Ibrahim El-Zakzaky.
National Daily recalls that the United Kingdom had earlier cautioned both the federal government and the Shi’ite Muslims over the violent confrontation in Abuja and its environs in recent time; calling for restraint on either side.
National Daily, however, gathered that the renewed caution was made by the outgoing British High Commissioner to Nigeria, Paul Arkwright, who on Thursday in Abuja, issued fresh warning to the Shi’ites and security operatives to observe rule of law in their engagements.
It was gathered that Arkwright, at a media interaction in Abuja to round up the visit of the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall, remarked that though he was not in a position to advise the Nigerian government, his view was that both parties must obey the rule of the land in the course of their activities.
The High Commissioner condemned the recent clashes between the Shi’ites and the government that caused the death of some protesting Shiite members, noting it was unfortunate that it happened.
“I don’t give advice to the Nigerian government. What I said on the question of the IMN in the past, and I am happy to repeat it, is that just as IMN must obey the rule of law by peaceful demonstration, it is also important for the security forces in Nigeria to respect the rule of law,” Arkwright had said.
He further noted that the Nigerian government should not be biased in its investigation of the Shi’ites confrontation with the Police and Army; expressing the hope that an independent report will analyse the entire scenario to make recommendations on the way forward for the government.
