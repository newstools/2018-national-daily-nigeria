Thousands of youths to the streets in Akwa Ibom State where they declared the obituary of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state. National Daily gathered that the youths in their hundreds of thousands declared support for Governor Udom Emmanuel, the governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for the 2019 elections, and subsequently carried out a procession where they conducted the funeral of the APC at Edemaya, the country home of the APC governorship candidate, Nsima U. Ekere, the Managing Director of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC).
The rally was said to be well-attended by several other stakeholders in the state.
National Daily further gathered that the youths demonstrated their anger, protesting that they are tired of empty promises and can no longer continue with a man pretending to be the leader of the people but cannot facilitate development to their community.
The APC has been home to former Governor Godswill Akpabio and other former PDP leaders in Akwa Ibom State.
