The Vice Presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Peter Obi, has articulated the view that the search by security operatives of the private jet of Atiku Abubakar at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport when his arrived the country from Dubai was an open attack on the Opposition PDP; stating that it was done because Atiku is the presidential candidate of the opposition PDP.
National Daily gathered that Obi, speaking on the Morning Show of Arise Television, monitored from Lagos, protested: “His only offence is that he is the presidential candidate of an opposition party. It is not as if you are not allowed to do a routine check.”
The former Governor of Anambra State further declared: “I’ve been privileged to have traveled with a number of high-profile people in the past in a private jet where they gave me a lift. I’ve not experienced what was experienced. What I am saying is that we have a country and what we need now is to be showing each other love and show the example to the younger ones that we are not divided, that we are together, that we want the country to work. It’s about the country.
“All these divisions are not necessary for our future. But what we do is that we are dividing the country. But you see people coming to a programme chanting war songs. It shouldn’t be.”
