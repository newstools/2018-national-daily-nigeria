Reports in some sections of local media have it that Coach Ayeni has been unveiled as technical manager to a Rivers State based NPFL Club Side, but the Coach has come out categorically to deny the claim and reiterate his commitment to the Centre of attraction side.
“When you get the opportunity to work with a very young, talented and discipline set of players like what I have at my disposal and with a dedicated management with a Chairman who has vision, you easily achieve success and off cause you begin to hear news like this,’’ Ayeni told National Daily.
“When the rumour got to me, I was shocked because I never made such a decision. I am busy here in our close camp with the team’s preparations for our next task which is to do well at the 2018 Gold Cup in Ado Ekiti. That story is totally not true. I remain committed to my job with Cynosure Fc.’’ Ayeni concluded.
National Daily learnt that Cynosure FC wish to inform the general public to discard any rumour or report not emanating from the club.
