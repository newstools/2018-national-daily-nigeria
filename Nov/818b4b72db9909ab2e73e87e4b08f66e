More than N540 milliom has been recovered by the EFCC through the Whistleblower Policy as at May 2018, according to Information Minister Lai Mohammed.
According to a statement from Mr Mohammed’s media assistant Segun Adeyemi on Tuesday, the minister stated this at the 71st General Assembly of the Broadcasting Organisations of Nigeria (BON) in Port Harcourt, Rivers State.
Giving the breakdown, the minister, through his representative, said the monies recovered included over N527 billion, $53 million, and £122,890.”
“This effort should not be seen as the sole effort of Mr. President or the government alone. The media has a duty to ensure that the programmes of government, meant to uplift the lots of the citizenry, are projected as a national cause and not just as that of Mr President or the administration,” he said.
According to the minister, anything short of this would amount to a criminal abdication of a sacred duty which could spell doom for our collective national life.
“It is therefore of utmost importance that the media and specifically, broadcast media, do not allow itself to become a purveyor of fake news and hate speeches,” the minister said.
The policy was introduced early on in the administration of Buhari— to aid the war against corruption.
