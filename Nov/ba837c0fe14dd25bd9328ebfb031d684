Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, once said that about 7.6 million children in 22 states across the country were being fed daily under the National Home Grown School Feeding Programme (NHGSFP).
He explained that the purpose of NHGSFP was to ensure that children in public primary schools across the country would have at least one very good meal daily.
“I have tasted the food myself and I think it is quite nice,” he said.
But the two videos above tells a different story. The first video shows how terrible looking and shrinked size breads are divided small chunks as they are served with poor nurished and questionable stew.
The other video shows how students are being feld a terrible looking Porridge on excercise book papers. The papers are used as plates but the pupils.
