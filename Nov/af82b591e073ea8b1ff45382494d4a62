France overcame an injury to Kylian Mbappe as Olivier Giroud scored from the spot to earn a 1-0 friendly win over Uruguay,National Daily learnt.
Aiming to return to winning ways following their UEFA Nations League exit, France’s task was made harder when Mbappe – who had squandered a great early chance – went off with a shoulder injury following an awkward collision with visiting goalkeeper Martin Campana.
But, having failed to score in the first half for a fourth successive game, France’s luck changed when Martin Caceres was harshly adjudged to have handled Antoine Griezmann’s effort.
Giroud made no mistake from the resulting penalty, ensuring that Mbappe’s absence was not felt too much by Didier Deschamp’s side.
