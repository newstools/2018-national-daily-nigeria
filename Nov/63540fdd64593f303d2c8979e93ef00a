A South African pastor, identified as Alfred Ndlovu, has died of malnutrition after going without food for thirty days following an attempt to emulate Jesus Christ and fast for 40 days and 40 nights.

Buzz South Africa reports that the 44-year-old clergyman left home for a nearby bush to have prayers, just like Jesus did.
It was learned that Pastor Ndlovu died just a month despite having no history of illness after he had tried to equal or break Jesus Christ’s record of fasting for 40 days.

The report said the Pastor was alone in the wilderness and his body was found by a stranger who then called the police.

Until his death, the deceased was known by his family and community at large as a very spiritual person whose faith could move mountains and his death surprised everyone, even church members.

Reacting to the death of the clergyman, one close relative said: ‘He was a very spiritual man. It’s unfortunate he had to die this way. After a month we got the sad news of his death. The pastor was a healthy and religious old man who did not even look his age.
