Senator Shehu Sani, representing Kaduna Central in the National Assembly, expressed strong view that President Muhammdu Buhari owe it a duty to apologise to former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for the embarrassment and intimidation unleashed on him at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja, on his arrival from Dubai last Sunday. The Senator, specifically, advised the federal government to humble itself and apologise to Atiku Abubakar.
National Daily gathered that Shehu Sani in a tweet, protested that the search of Atiku’s private jet by security operatives was an “act of intimidation and harassment camouflaged as a routine”.
The Senator maintained that the security operatives were overzealous; he advocated that the federal government should be humble enough to tender an apology.
Security operatives from the Department of State Services (DSS), on Sunday conducted search on the jet in which Atiku flew into Nigeria from Dubai after his holidays in the United Arab Emirate (UAE). The search of the jet generated wide disquiet across the country, compelling the federal government to explain that it was a routine check being conducted on persons arriving the international airport by the Immigration, DSS and other security operatives at the Airport.
However, Senator Shehu Sani declared: “The overzealous acts of the security personnel at the Abuja Airport against the former Vice President Atiku stands out rightly condemned. We have been through this in our history. Intimidation and harassment camouflaged as routine. The FG should be humble and apologize to him.
