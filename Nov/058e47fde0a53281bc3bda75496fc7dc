Titi Abubakar, wife of the Presidential candidate of the Peopels Democratic Party in the 2019 general elections, former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, Waziri Adamawa, counseled the new set of students graduating from the Feed and Read Programme of the American University of Nigeria (AUN) to show good examples of the values that can be imbibed through education.
Mrs. Abubakar, delivering a keynote speech at the graudation of pupils who previously were itinerant children but were recruited by the AUN as beneficiaries of the Feed and Read programme which offers the pupils meals every day, medical care, encouraged them to assimilate elementary lessons in arithmetic and English Language.
The wife of the PDP Presidential candidate advocated that all hands must be on deck to ensure that Nigerian children do not live by the street; saving them, especially, the girl child, from the dangers of alms begging and prostitution.
Titi Abubakar declared: “We don’t want to neglect our children. We don’t want them to become a miscreant on the street of Nigeria. We want to feed them. We want to cloth them. We want them too to be people in future. And this is exactly what the founder (Atiku) is doing; that there is dignity in labor; that our children should not be found wanting.
“Our children should not be found wandering on the street of Rome because tomorrow we don’t know what they are going to become. These ones were picked from the street and the institute trained them for nine months. Now, they are free to go into primary school. “That is why there is no age limit in education.
“These ones were being picked from the street; they had spent nine month, and we can see them – they can read, they can write, they have started speaking English. And only God knows, the sky is going to be their limit.”
