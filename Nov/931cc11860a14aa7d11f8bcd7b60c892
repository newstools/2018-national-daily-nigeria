Project Pink Blue, a Non-Governmental Organisation, says it organised a music and comedy event to raise funds for cancer patients in the country.
Mr Runcie Chidebe, the Executive Director of the organisation, said this while declaring the show open in Abuja.
Chidebe noted that it was imperative for Nigerians to help indigent cancer patients as the disease became rampant.
The show, tagged “Show Love”, is meant to encourage and engage Nigerians to financially support indigent cancer patients.
According to Chidebe, awareness of cancer without adequate provision for treatment can make the victims lose their lives due to the thoughts of treatment alone.
“I started the fight for cancer victims while I was serving in the year 2013 when I met a cancer victim who finally died because of inadequate funds for treatment.
“The rising cost of cancer treatment and poverty has remained major impediments for several cancer patients to afford cancer treatment in Nigeria.
“We believe that early detection and treatment can save a lot of lives but lack of funds hampers survival chances of a lot of people.
“The funds realised today would be used as a trust fund which will be made available to patients at any given time.
“I implore cancer patients who find funds as impediments to their treatment to log on to our website at www.projectpinkblue.org and make their case, and we will follow up from there,” he said.
Gov. Abubakar Bagudu of Kebbi State said that it was important for Nigerians to donate to cancer treatment as it would go a long way to reducing preventable deaths in the country.
“With less people affected with cancer, we will be able to fund more people already on treatment,” he said.
