Police trucks barricade the road leading to the Akwa Ibom state House of Assembly located at Udo Udoma avenue in Uyo
Though no reason was given for the security action, there are indications that it may be connected to the political tension that followed the sack of some legislators who recently defected from the PDP to the APC
The Akwa Ibom state House of Assembly was on Wednesday morning, November 21, sealed off by a team of policemen.
National daily reports that police trucks barricaded the road leading to the legislative building located at Udo Udoma avenue in Uyo.
The newspaper reports that several anti-riot police officers were seen on the already deserted road.
“Sorry, there’s no thoroughfare; nobody is allowed to drive or walk through this road,” one of the police officers barricading the road said.
Though no reason was given for the police action, National Daily learned that the security action may be connected with the political tension that followed the sack of some legislators who recently defected from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the All Progressives Congress (APC).
Meanwhile, Adams Oshiomhole, the national chairman, the All Progressives Congress (APC), has alleged that members of his party are being killed, kidnapped and intimidated across states controlled by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).
The national chairman made the allegation when speaking to journalists at the APC secretariat on Monday night, November 19.
Oshiomhole accused PDP governors of using state institutions to undermine the basic democratic rights of APC members in states they govern, a situation he described as disturbing.
