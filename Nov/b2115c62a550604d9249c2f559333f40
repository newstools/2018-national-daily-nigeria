The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on Thursday told the Inspector General of Police, Ibrahim Idris, to resign before the general elections in 2019.
The Opposition PDP also told the Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Professor Mahmood Yakubu, to resign his position before the elections.
PDP National Chairman, Uche Secondus, at the National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting of the party at the National Secretariat in Abuja, accused the IG of Police of working for the incumbent president and his political party, All Progressives Congress (APC) to arrest and intimidate the opponents; Secondus also alleged that the INEC Chairman lacks the will and capacity to deliver free and fair elections in 2019.
However, the IG of Police through the Force Public Relations Officer, Jimoh Moshood, was of the view that the allegation holds no water, describing the demand by the opposition PDP for the resignation of the Inspector General Police as laughable.
Moshood stated that the Nigeria Police have remained apolitical and does not work in favour of any political party.
The FPRO challenged the PDP to make public or report any case of compromise by the Police.
Moshood maintained that the police were only focused on law enforcement and ensuring that the forthcoming elections were conducted peacefully.
