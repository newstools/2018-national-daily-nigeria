Barcelona’s hopes of retaining their La Liga crown took a bit of a blow on Sunday afternoon.
After impressing without Lionel Messi in recent games, the Blaugrana were simply woeful on his return, losing 4-3 to Real Betis at the Nou Camp.
The Argentine may have scored twice, but was powerless to stop Quique Setien’s side from scoring four times.
Ivan Rakitic was also shown a red card late on to compound Ernesto Valverde’s misery.
Luckily for Barca, they have the international break to regroup and plan for their potential ‘six-pointer’ away at Atletico Madrid in two weeks time.
The players looked visibly annoyed at themselves after the final whistle, but midfield anchorman Sergio Busquets really showed his class.
Setien asked for the Spaniard’s shirt after the game and Busquets not only gave it to him, but also sent a lovely message to the Betis boss.
The message from Busquets read: “To Quique with appreciation and admiration for the way you see football. Kind regards.”
Busuqets is clearly a fan of the Betis manager.
After watching the performance from the Seville side in Catalonia, it’s safe to say that Setien will be a candidate for the Barca job in the future.
Summer signing Arturo Vidal had some very strong words for his Barca teammates after the game.

“We started badly and they took advantage of the two chances they had in the first half and like this it’s difficult, we can’t lose like this at home,” Vidal said.
“In the second half we tried but we lacked luck, but we have to keep working.”
The Chilean also picked up on the clear defensive fragility on display from the Blaugrana.
“Yes we had chanes to come back but we have to improve other things. Teams can’t come here and bang in four goals against us,” he said. “We hae to work on that, see the mistakes and make sure they don’t happen again.”
