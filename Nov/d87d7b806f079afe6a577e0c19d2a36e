Bukayo Saka is the latest prodigious youngster to come off Arsenal’s talent conveyor belt.
The 17-year-old has turned in consistent performances for the U23s this season and won a penalty in the recent Checkatrade Trophy match against Forest Green Rovers after beating more than four defenders with a skilful run.
Joe Willock, who scored twice in that game, told Arsenal Player that Saka “is one of the most talented players we have in the team” before describing him as “fast” and “if you play to his strengths he’s unstoppable at times,” – high praise for a winger who has contributed to 11 goals for the youth teams this season, which works out as a goal every 79.5 minutes.
Born and raised in London, Saka is of Nigerian descent and has represented England at youth level where he currently plays for the Under-19s. He recently scored just three minutes into his debut in a 4-0 win over Moldova, finishing Stephen Walker’s through ball to score the third goal for England.
A direct, tricky left winger who is one of the youngest players in the U23 set-up, Saka remains highly regarded by his coaches at Hale End and there is a growing belief that he could be close to making a first-team appearance if his performances continue on the same level for the youth teams.
“Bukayo is a great talent and played very, very well today,” Ljungberg told
Arsenal Player after the 4-0 win over Liverpool in September.
