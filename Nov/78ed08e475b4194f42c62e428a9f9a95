Max Allegri affirms ‘I hope to stay at Juventus for a long time’ after winning the Panchina d’Oro award for best Italian Coach of 2018.
Allegri beat off competition from Chelsea boss Maurizio Sarri and Lazio’s Simone Inzaghi, who finished third and fourth respectively, while he becomes the Coach with the most Panchina d’Oro victories on four.
“Like I always say, the less damage we do the better,” he said upon receiving the accolade at Coverciano.
“I thank my staff, who take so much pressure off me and let me grow older more slowly.
“Credit must also go to the players and club. I hope to stay here for a long time. Now I’m more reflective. My years of experience in Serie A have let me grow.
“The objective is to win our eighth Scudetto and then this blessed Champions League.
“We’ll see if we have a bit of luck on our side. The important thing is to understand how we’ll be in March.
“The level has risen, so we must have the quality to match. For the Scudetto, however, our attentions are on Napoli and Inter.”
