Antonio Conte will ‘never say never’ to coaching in Serie A again and claims he was not a good fit for Real Madrid.
Conte witnessed Max Allegri defend the Panchina d’Oro award at Coverciano on Monday, and the former Juventus, Chelsea and Italy Coach spoke after the ceremony to Calciomercato.com.
“Do I see myself in an important dugout soon? I see myself at home today,” revealed the 49-year-old.
“I’m recharging my batteries at the moment, watching a few games and following some of my colleagues.
“Future in Italy? Never say never. I’m Italian, I feel good here and I’d like to work, without excluding going abroad of course.
“Four or five teams can win the Champions League, and one of them are Juventus. They’re a club who have given themselves a very important structure.
“They’ve signed some great champions and their rivals in Italy must get a move on because they’ve created a wave.
“If I had CR7? I don’t want to think about it. I’m very proud of the players I coached at Juve. For the type of Coach I am, I preferred to wait until June to find a new job.
“After that, I want to coach again in maybe 2-3 months and deny what I’m saying now…”
