Former Real Madrid player Roberto Carlos spoke at a promotional event in which he will choose the best freestyler in the world, saying “I think all the clubs in the world would like to have a player like Neymar. He is an incredible footballer with incredible abilities and I think he will soon be the best in the world. Footballers like him are what not only my club, Real Madrid, need, but all the best teams in the world. ”
The Brazilian also referred to the new players that are leaving South America. We hope to see new young people with the skills and attitude to become great champions. This is precisely what we expect to happen at Real Madrid with players like Vinicius Junior, who already debuted with the first team, or like Rodrygo, who is currently on loan at Santos de Brasil. ”
About which players of his time he stays, he said “that is a difficult question, because I have played with many incredible players. If I had to choose, I would choose Robinho, Ronaldinho, Ronaldo and Zizou. They are the players who have impressed me most with the ball at their feet. “
