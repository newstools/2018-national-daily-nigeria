The Garden City of Port Harcourt will come alive from 12th to 17th of November 2018 as combat athletes from across the country will converge on  Port Harcourt for the first ever Rivers National Kick boxing and Karate championship.

Chairman technical committee of the local organising, Segun Abude said the championship will serve as a preparatory  ground for major competitions like the National Sports festival and Olympic games.

Abude who is also a former national champion, heaped praise on the facilitator of the Championship, Chief Marco Purgatorio for reviving combat sports in the state.

“This championship is timely because it will put participating athletes in competition mood ahead of the national sports festival,which is less than five weeks from today and also serve as a template for potential representatives at the Tokyo Olympics”. Abude said

“Kudos must go to Chief Marco Purgatorio who has done well for the development of kick boxing and Karate in the state and country,

Karate has a face value in the state because we have somebody like Chief Marco”.

Meanwhile arrival of athletes is on 12th November. Registration and accreditation will hold 13th November  while the competition will start on the 14th November at the indoor sports hall of the Alfred Diette Spiff Civic centre in Port Harcourt.
