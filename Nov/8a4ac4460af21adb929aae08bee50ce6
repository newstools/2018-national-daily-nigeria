The Senate has mandated its Committee on Police Affairs to investigate the alleged assassination attempt on the Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu, and members of his family.
Recall that Uche Anichukwu, media aide of Ekweremadu, had earlier disclosed that the Abuja residence of the deputy senate president was invaded by gunmen in the wee hours of Tuesday.
Speaking after the incident, Ekweremadu said the response of the police to the incident was poor. The lawmaker said the security of the citizens is not in the hands of government but God.
“It was about 4am this morning that some people evaded the security in my house and got all the way to my room where I was sleeping with my wife. There was a struggle, there was a fight with heavy commotion and by the grace of God, we eventually caught one of them and the rest escaped,” the senator recounted.
“We handed that one over to the police investigating the matter. The annoying aspect of it or the one that is worrisome is that at that point, I called the inspector-general of police (IGP), his phone was off. I called some of his aides, their phones rang out and nobody replied till now. I called DIG operations, till I left my house nobody showed up.
President of the Senate, Bukola Saraki, berated the Nigeria Police for their alleged late response to Ekweremadu’s emergency calls.
He also mandated the committee to follow up on the investigations by the police.
