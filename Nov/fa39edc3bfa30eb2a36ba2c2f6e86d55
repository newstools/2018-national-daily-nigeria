Despite being named Woman-of-the-Match  award in the first game of the 2018 Nigeria Women’s Professional League campaign against Police Female Machine of Uyo, Moje Queens skipper, Kafayat Shittu, was not happy with her team’s performance and thought they should have done better.
The mercurial midfielder believed her team was poor and made too many mistakes against their opponent from Uyo.
Two strikes from in-form forward Aguhe Chinorulum and a late goal from diminutive  winger Gloria Archibong ensured a bitter loss for the girls from Erinle.
Shittu insists that her side would have to do better on Wednesday when they face Dream Stars FC of Lagos at the University of Benin Sports Complex.
“We have to improve on our next game, if we are to have any chance of getting promotion into the elite league. Shittu told National Daily .
“Police Machine are a difficult team to play against and I think they are more experienced too. We will learn from our mistakes as I am not happy with our performance today, but we shall win our next game. She concluded.
Moje Queens will face Dream Stars FC of Lagos in their final game of the Nigeria Women Football Pro-League on Wednesday at the University of Benin Sports Complex, Benin City in Group B.
