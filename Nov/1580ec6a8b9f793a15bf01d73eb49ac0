Mauricio Pochettino says he ‘dreams’ of leading Tottenham to the Premier League title in their new stadium.
The manager has again reiterated his commitment to the north London club, saying he is desperate to achieve silverware with his talented Spurs side.
There have been plenty of rumors surrounding Pochettino in recent months, with reports linking him with the Manchester United and Real Madrid jobs.
The boss has also made it no secret of his desire to take charge of the Argentina national team, with whom he made 20 appearances as a player.
But, quizzed by the Italian press ahead of Spurs’ Champions League clash against Inter Milan on Wednesday night, Pochettino made it clear where he sees his future… as long as Chairman Daniel Levy agrees.
Asked where he sees himself in five years’ time, the Tottenham manager said: “Seriously, today I see myself here.
“My contract expires in four and a half years… if Levy does not fire me first,” he laughed.
“I dream of winning a trophy with Tottenham, maybe the Premier League in our new stadium.
“In the future to also guide the Argentine team is my desire.
“The important thing is to be happy, and I am right now.”
