Germany have been relegated from League A of the inaugural Nations League, as a dreadful 2018 for Joachim Low’s side got even worse,National Daily learnt.
Netherlands’ impressive 2-0 home victory over world champions France in Rotterdam on Friday ensured Germany will finish bottom of Group 1 in League A, which is the UEFA competition’s top tier.
Georginio Wijnaldum’s strike just before half-time and a stoppage-time penalty from Memphis Depay sealed the 2014 World Cup winners’ fate.
National Daily gathered that Germany’s relegation comes with a game to spare – they still have to host Netherlands on Monday having only picked up one point from their three Nations League games to date.
They join Iceland and Poland in being relegated from the top tier. Croatia or England will join that trio in League B next season.
