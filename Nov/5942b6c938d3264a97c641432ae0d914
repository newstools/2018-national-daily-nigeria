Bayern Munich striker Robert Lewandowski has reached 50 Champions League goals and has hit that mark in fewer games than Cristiano Ronaldo and Thierry Henry required,National Daily learnt.
The prolific Pole brought up his half-century during a clash with Benfica on Tuesday.
That outing was his 77th in Europeâ€™s elite club competition, with his bow made back in 2011.
Lewandowski is now the seventh man to record 50 efforts in the Champions League, with former Arsenal and Barcelona forward Henry briefly joined on that mark before hitting a second against Benfica.
The only players above him are Ruud van Nistelrooy, Karim Benzema, Raul, Lionel Messi and Ronaldo.
Barcelona talisman Messi took 66 games to reach a notable milestone in continental action, while ex-Manchester United and Real Madrid star Van Nistelrooy required just 62.
