Didier Drogba has hinted he may have changed his mind about retirement, posting a clip on Twitter indicating he is going to continue playing.
The former Chelsea star has played the last couple of seasons with Phoenix Rising FC of the United Soccer League, the second division in the United States.
Last March, Drogba said his playing career would come to an end at the conclusion of Phoenix’s season, which happened last night as his side lost 1-0 in the USL Cup final to Louisville City.
But now the 40-year-old may have changed his mind on the matter, as he has posted a clip on Twitter from the movie “The Wolf of Wall Street.”
In the scene the main character from the movie, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, is expected to announce he is stepping aside from his company, but instead announces to his staff that he is remaining, saying: “You know, what? I’m not leaving.”
