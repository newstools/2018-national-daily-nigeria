Edinson Cavani spoke about the Golden Ball that is presented on December 3 in Paris. The Uruguayan forward ran on who would give him this award. He thinks Modric, the top favorite, does not deserve it. He thinks that he should win a footballer of the French team, who were the ones who won the crown of World Champions.
“Varane may well be there, Griezmann, Mbappé … I think a Frenchman should win, there are other players who could, but he should be a Frenchman, they have won the World Cup,” he said in an interview with French radio station RMC.
“Modric has had a great season, but his teammate Varane won the Champions League and the World Cup, Modric was a finalist and had a great campaign, but Varane deserves it more,” he said.
Cavani clarified his situation with Neymar
“I talked to him after the game we played against Brazil, off the pitch there’s no problem, it’s not serious, we play in different teams and we defend our interests,” he admitted on Tuesday after Uruguay’s friendly against France.
