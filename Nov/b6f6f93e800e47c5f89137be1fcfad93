Juventus will reportedly look to replace Alex Sandro with Marcelo or Alex Grimaldo next summer.
According to Corriere di Torino, Juve are ready to sell Alex Sandro in July after his recent declaration that he wants to play in the Premier League.
Consequently, the Bianconeri would be targeting Marcelo and Grimaldo to fill the void left by the Brazilian.
The Real Madrid full-back still has four years left to run on his contract, but his extension was signed when Cristiano Ronaldo was still at the club and he is known to have a close rapport with the No 7.
The Barcelona youth product, meanwhile, is said to have already given the green light to joining the Old Lady, although a fee would still need to be agreed with Benfica.
