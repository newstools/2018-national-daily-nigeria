Picks Haleemat Busari as running mate




The governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), in Lagos State, Mr Jimi Agbaje, is getting set to uproot the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) from the state in the 2019 general elections. Agbaje has caused an upset in 2015 when he led the PDP to win elections into the State House of Assembly and the House of representatives in Abuja.
In the preparations for the 2019 governorship race in Lagos, Agbaje has chosen Mrs. Haleemat Busari as the Deputy Governorship candidate for the election.
Director of Media and Publicity of the Jimi Agbaje Campaign Organisation (JACO), Mr. Felix Oboagwina, in a statement explained that the choice of Busari, a lawyer, was a result of wide consultations with leaders and stakeholders within and outside the PDP.
“Mrs. Oluwayemisi Haleemat Busari became highly recommended and widely endorsed.
“Stakeholders all agree that without any iota of doubt, the Jimi-Haleemat combination is a winning ticket on every count,” Oboagwina stated.
Meanwhile, the INEC has fixed the takeoff date for campaigns for November 18, 2018.
