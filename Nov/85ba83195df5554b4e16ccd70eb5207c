State and Wake County election officials are encountering some problems with machines failing to read ballots thanks to humidity and the ballots’ size, but said that all votes will be counted.
Tuesday morning, the state said high humidity levels had been reported at Wake County poll sites, according to a news release from the N.C. State Board of Elections.
Wake County Board of Elections Director Gary Sims said there is “nothing wrong” with the current tabulators. But the problems aren’t limited to humidity. He said some are due to the ballots’ 17-inch length.
“We’ve never had a 17-inch ballot and level of humidity we’re having today,” he said at a Tuesday afternoon press conference at the Wake County Board of Elections office.
He said issues were reported at 15 precincts earlier in the day with eight still being resolved.
Elections officials said they want to assure voters “that procedures are in place for these types of events,” according to the Board of Elections release.
