Harrysong the reggae and blues singer who has been going through depression seem to have found people who will cheer him up, and Bobrisky seems like his catch.
They’ve been friends for a very long time so we’re not surprised, Bobrisky has been promoting almost all his songs.
But then again, seeing them like this in a plane sends alot of message, like there’s more to it than we see.
With Bobrisky sitting on the lower part of the plane wearing a gown, and Harrysong standing like a guardian, We can only wish them the best, As a matter of fact their fans are already asking if they’re dating.
