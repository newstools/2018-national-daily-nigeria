Senate President Bukola Saraki has urged the Senate Committee on Police Reform affairs to fast- track the public hearing of the bill.
Reacting to a point of order raised by Senator Tijjani Kaura, who drew the attention of the Senate to the kidnapping of 100 persons in Zamfara State, Saraki said the Bill, when passed, will help curb kidnappings across the nation
Speaking on the point of order, the Senate President said: “This is of great concern because of the level of kidnapping we are seeing in the state. I am happy that it is Senator Garba heading the Committee on Police.
“We have the Police Reform Bill that will address some of the issues because I think the institutional issues need to be addressed to solve medium and long term problems; they are clearly issues of manpower, training, equipment and funding.
“These are issues that we must address holistically. We need to move very fast. Sen. Garba should fast track the process and let us have that bill ready for public hearing and come here to review it and see how, with the support of the police, we can effectively fight crimes and prevent these kinds of situations.
