Two yahoo boys and a security guard have been arrested in connection with the murder of 22-year-old Elozino Joshualia Ogege, a first-class Mass Communications student, found dead at Ekrejeta road in Abraka Community, Ethiope-East Local Government Area of Delta State on November 18, 2018.
Recall that friends of the deceased had took to the social media last week declaring her missing. Her corpse was later found by residents along Ekrejeta road in Abraka Community, Ethiope-East Local Government Area of Delta State with her tongue and breasts missing.
With the complaints of ritual killings, murder, kidnappings, armed robbery, rape, and other issues on the rise in that vicinity, students suspect Ogege might have been killed for ritual purposes.
The Delta State Commissioner of Police, Muhammad Mustafa said, “Some of the major suspects connected to the crime had been arrested and currently assisting the police with their investigation.” Efforts are ongoing to arrest other actors in the crime.”
Meanwhile reacting to the surge of kidnappings in the state, Chairman of the Committee for the Defence of Human Rights (CDHR) Comrade Prince Kehinde-Taiga called for the redeployment of the state Commissioner of Police, CP Muhammad Mustafa whom he says has been sleeping on duty while atrocities have continued raging.
Taiga says, “The perpetrators must be brought to book without any form of compromise. The CP must wake up from his slumber because justice must be served.”
