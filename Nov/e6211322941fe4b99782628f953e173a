The Rumuolumeni Police Divisional Headquarters in Obio/Akpor Local Government Area, Rivers State, at the week end arrested a Catholic priest, Menegbo, and three other suspects over child theft. The suspects are still in the detention of the Police for interrogation since their arrest on Saturday.
National Daily gathered that the Police accused Menegbo of conspiracy with two other suspects, Helen and Gift, to steal two children at Ngbakatali in Rumuolumeni in Obio/Akpor Local Government Area, Rivers State.
It was indicated that the kidnappers struck on Saturday afternoon while the priest was held by passersby and natives at the scene of the incidence. It was narrated that community members who caught Menegbo, took him to the palace of the paramount ruler, who then directed them to handover him over to the Police for investigation.
Father of the two children, Stanley Obisike, from Ibaa community in Emohua Local Government Area, was gathered to have acknowledged that the priest had visited his shop when his wife was with the children. Obisike narrated that Menegbo pretended to have come to buy something, and later left with the children, who are between one and three years, to the apartment of the other suspects in the neighborhood to discuss with them.
Menegbo was said to have taken the two children inside his tinted glass black Peugeot car and was about to drive out before the mother of the children raised alarm.
