Zinedine Zidane’s future remains one of the main talking points in the football world ever since his departure from Real Madrid last season.
The 46-year-old Frenchman has been heavily linked with Manchester United after José Mourinho’s up-and-down season at Old Trafford this sea
Meanwhile, the back-to-back Champions League-winning coach has been linked with a role as technical director at Juventus, along with recently dropping his biggest hint that his future might be at the Old Lady. However, that could be about to change after a top-tier European club is looking to tempt the former Real Madrid star with a new challenge.
Bayern Munich have offered Zidane the managerial position at the club next season after pressure continues to mount on current boss Niko Kovač, according to OKDIARIO’s Eduardo Inda.
The reigning Bundesliga champions want the former Madrid boss to take on the project, though the German club will have to wait and see if he is interested in their plan.
Bayern Munich suffered a 3-2 defeat to rivals Borussia Dortmund last weekend.
Dortmund remains top of the Bundesliga and have opened a seven-point rift over third-placed Munich.
Despite a major setback for the Bavarians, Kovač is already planning ahead for the future.
“We saw a fantastic football match from both sides,” he said.
“In the first half, we had the game in hand, then in the second half, Dortmund did. Unfortunately, we lost the game, even though it could have been a draw.
“You can be satisfied with the performance. That was the best game since Schalke — skillful, combative and tactical, especially in the first half.
“We will have to build on that and deliver more games in the future.”
