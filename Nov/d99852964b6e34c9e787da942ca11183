Real Madrid have completed the signing of River Plate midfielder Exequiel Palacios and he will arrive in January, says a report in Marca.
Last month, River Plate president Rodolfo D’Onofrio accused Madrid of acting ‘dishonestly’ and ‘disrespectfully’ over their pursuit of the midfielder, who has also been linked to Barcelona.
The midfielder’s release clause is said to stand at €20m with Los Blancos agreeing a five-and-a-half-year contract which will commence in January.
Palacios made his debut for River as a 16-year-old and has recently won two international caps for Argentina, attracting interest from both Barcelona and Atletico Madrid.
Paris Saint-Germain and Manchester City have also been linked with the midfielder which is said to have speeded up Madrid’s pursuit of the deal.
The central midfielder has made just 46 first-team appearances for River although 19 of those have arrived this year.
Such a move would represent a continuation of Madrid’s policy of signing young South American players with Brazilian teenagers Vinicius Junior and Rodrygo Goes captured this year.
