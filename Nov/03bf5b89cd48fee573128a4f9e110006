The PDP members in the Ekiti State House of Assembly have refused to accept the leadership of former Gov. Ayo Fayose which the party is foisting on them.
They insist their loyalty is for Senate Minority Leader Abiodun Olujimi.
Deputy Speaker Olusegun Adewumi, who spoke on behalf of his colleagues, said this while addressing journalists in Ado Ekiti on Tuesday.
According to him, Olujimi is the most eminently qualified at the moment to be in the leadership position as the highest political office holder presently in the state.
He described anybody resisting that decision as “mischievous, lazy and political jobbers.
“There is no contest about the leadership of the party since the position is not contested but earned,” he said.
He also said the House of Representatives caucus members in Ekiti as “yes men” who were not capable of having opinions of their own.
