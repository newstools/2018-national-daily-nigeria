David de Gea reportedly wants a pay packet of £350,000 a week plus bonuses in order to sign a new contract at Manchester United . De Gea’s current deal with United will expire in June 2019, and despite the Red Devils having the option of a 12-month extension, there remains huge uncertainty surrounding his future. The 27-year-old is believed to be weighing up his future at Old Trafford, with Jose Mourinho ‘s side currently struggling to challenge for the major trophies. De Gea had previously been strongly linked with a move to Real Madrid, but the European champions signed Thibaut Courtois as their new number one ahead of the 2018-19 campaign. Juventus and Paris Saint-Germain have recently been linked with a move, but Mourinho said on Tuesday night that the goalkeeper wants to stay at Old Trafford. According to the Daily Mail, De Gea is open to penning a new deal, but he wants to match Alexis Sanchez ‘s £350,000-a-week deal plus bonuses, and is also keen for assurances when it comes to United’s future plans. Indeed, the 20-time English champions are currently seventh in the Premier League table , some 14 points off the leaders Manchester City.
De Gea has made 333 appearances in all competitions for United since a 2011 move from Atletico Madrid, winning one Premier League title, the FA Cup and the League Cup during his time in England.
