National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole, says the right thing for the President of the Senate, Bukola Saraki, to do will be to vacate his seat as senate president, having left the party.
While appearing on a television programme monitored by National Daily on Tuesday, Oshiomhole said the ruling party has not jettisoned its resolved to have the senate president removed.
“I think it’s about morality. We just had an election in the US. The democrats won more members in the congress. Without much ado, the leadership of the house changed. This question didn’t have to arise.
“Saraki belongs to a minority party as it stands today in the senate. The truth about democracy is that it’s a game of numbers. It’s unacceptable that minority provides leadership over majority.”
Also reacting to a question on the crisis rocking the party over its primaries in some states, the former Edo state governor, said the APC is prone to controversies because it is a large party.
Recall that the party chairman was detained by the Department of State Services (DSS) and grilled for nine hours after some governors alleged that he received bribes during the party’s primary elections across the country.
But he said aggrieved members of the party were allowed to grumble but the party has moved on and has put in place internal procedures for reconciliation.
“We have finished our primaries and we have submitted names to INEC and there are internal procedures for reconciliation and we are working on them,” he said.
“We are a large governing party and it will only be strange if we are having graveyard peace. People are allowed to grumble and grumbling is allowed. We should move on and find solutions.”
