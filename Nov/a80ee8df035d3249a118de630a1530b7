As Akwa United FC intensify preparations for the 2018/2019 NPFL season, Club Chairman Elder Paul Bassey has charged players of the team to maintain high level of discipline and professionalism as true professionals while focusing on the up coming season.

Elder Bassey gave the charge at the team’s training ground while addressing players and officials of the club after Wednesday’s training session in Uyo.

The  Club Chairman , Paul Bassey  told National Daily “we are preparing for a new football season, under a new Head Coach, so, we have to ensure that we take our training serious as true professionals”.

“We are an ambitious team with a target, for us to meet our target next season, we must collectively give our best beginning from the pre-season programmes”.

“My advise for you is to be more committed and dedicated in readiness for next season. We will be playing an abridged league which means we have to be on our toes throughout the season.”

“Our season is already running with the different pre-season programmes we have lined-up, so, do your best to desist from activities that may hinder your performance and the team’s progress in the coming season “.

The Promise Keepers will go into the new season under new Head Coach Rafael Everton who has been engaging the team in different pre-season programmes in preparation for the 2018/2019 NPFL season scheduled to kickoff in December.
