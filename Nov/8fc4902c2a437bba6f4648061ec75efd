Julius Numa, a resident of the Oton area, Sapele, Delta has hanged himself after church fund kept with him was stolen.
According to neighbours, Numa, 59, earlier sent text messages to his friends to help him raise the N600000 stolen or he would kill himself.
It was gathered that he had sent out a text message to his friends and relatives demanding for financial assistance or he would kill himself.
His daughter, one of the 11 children he had, later found their father’s body in his room Sunday.
“We suspected he must have killed himself over a harvest fund of N600,000 that was stolen from him weeks back.
“He was in charge of the harvest fund in the church and a few weeks back he was robbed by some boys at the Oton area of Sapele where the church is located, and since then he has been acting strange,” a source said.
“Some of the children even promised to help out this week, only for us to hear that he had killed himself.”
The police authorities have confirmed the incident.
A police source said the officers sent there on Sunday were not able to bring doen the dangling body.
Numa was however buried on Monday.
