The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) had on Tuesday accused President Muhammadu Buhari and the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) of plots secure questionable court orders from compromised judges to garnishee accounts of the opposition political party and critical stakeholders, perceived to be in opposition to re-election of the President.
PDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, in a statement in Abuja on Tuesday, indicated that PDP has already got the acquaintance of how instructions are being issued to agencies of government to trail and throw up fabrications in order to create an impression of financial infractions around the said accounts.
The PDP National Publicity Secretary declared in the statement: “Already, accounts belonging to critical stakeholders are being frisked with a view to have them liquidated ahead of the general elections.
“It is clear that the only reason for this is to ensure that our party and candidates are deprived of access to funds for campaigns, but the APC and the Buhari Presidency fail to realize that the 2019 election is now a battle between them and Nigerians, who are the bastion of the PDP.
“Nigerians have since taken over the saddle for the quest to rid the nation of this incompetent, vicious and vengeful administration, for which they are now freely making contributions and sacrifices. They have collectively resolved to vote out President Buhari and not even the APC’s on-going vote-buying strategy and intimidation can scuttle that resolve.”
