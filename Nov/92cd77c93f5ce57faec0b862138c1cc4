Jamie Vardy is auctioning off use of his executive box at Leicester City on Saturday to raise money for the foundation of late chairman Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha.
Leicester return to the King Power Stadium against Burnley, their first home game since Srivaddhanaprabha died in the tragic helicopter crash that killed four others soon after the draw with West Ham on October 27.
Vardy and wife Rebekah are offering the public a chance to bid for a hospitality package in their box at the ground.
The offer is one of a number of prizes to be auctioned off to help raise money for Leicester’s foundation, which has been renamed in honour of their late chairman.
On Tuesday, an inquest into the helicopter crash said there was ‘minimal chance’ for anyone to survive.
Other items available in the auction are the boots Vardy wore in the 1-0 win at Cardiff on Saturday, with ‘Khun Vichai’ embroidered on them, and a pair of goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel’s gloves.
Leicester have announced that they will not play any goal celebration music should they score against Burnley.
They normally play Kasabian’s Fire but won’t on this occasion as they seek to set the right tone on a sombre occasion.
