An environmentalist, Mr Taiwo Adewole, says the review of the Lagos State Environmental Law 2017 is long overdue.
Adewole, Chief Executive Officer of Taiwo Adewole and Associatesaid that the 2017 Environmental Law was done in a hurry.
He said that the previous Environmental Law was done to favour of Visionscape Sanitation Solutions and the state lawmakers had seen the flaws and now want to set the record straight.
”There are a lot of flaws because it was rushed and passed into law just to favour Visionscape, all in the name of Public Private Partnership (PPP),” the environmentalist said.
He said that while reviewing the law, the aspects of first line charge payment to Visionscape and the total scrapping of the Private Sector Participants (PSPs) should be looked into.
According to him, the area of introduction of Waste Collection Operators (WCO), which is selective of some selected PSPs, and killing of the Lagos Waste Management Authority (LAWMA) should be reviewed.
”The new law should give all opportunity previously given to Visionscape to the PSPs in terms of PPP and funding based on first line charge and signing of bonds for the indigenous PSP/investors,” he said.
