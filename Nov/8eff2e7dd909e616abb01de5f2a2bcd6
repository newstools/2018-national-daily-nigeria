Paul Pogba is an injury doubt for Manchester United’s derby clash with Manchester City after missing training on Friday.
The 25-year-old played the full 90 minutes against former club Juventus on Wednesday as Jose Mourinho’s side came back to secure a stunning 2-1 win in the Champions League.
However, Pogba was conspicuous by his absence from United’s training session on Friday – an unneeded injury scare ahead of Sunday’s derby at the Etihad Stadium.
United will be hoping that what is being described as a “little injury” will not keep the World Cup winner out against City.
It is understood that Pogba did indoor work at the Aon Training Complex on Friday as a result of the issue.
Romelu Lukaku is already a doubt for the derby, having missed the trips to Bournemouth and Juventus with a hamstring injury sustained last Friday.
