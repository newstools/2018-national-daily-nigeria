A disgraced former judge, who went to prison for beating his then-wife, so severely, in 2014, that she required facial reconstructive surgery, was taken into custody after she was found slain Saturday morning in the U.S


The Shaker Heights Police Department said officers responded to a 911 call at a residence in the morning, prompting them to launch an investigation into Aisha Fraser’s killing.

Ex-Cuyahoga County judge, Lance Mason, Fraser’s former husband, was then taken into custody. While trying to flee the scene, Mason drove an SUV into a police cruiser, causing “serious injuries” to a police officer’s lower legs and ribs, according to Cleveland.com.

He then tried to escape on foot and was arrested. Mason pleaded guilty in 2015 to attempted felonious assault and domestic violence after punching Fraser, 20 times, and slamming her head against the dashboard of a car, five times, in 2014.

He was released from prison after serving 9 months of a two-year sentence, after he apologised to Fraser.
