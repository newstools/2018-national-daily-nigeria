Thereafter, President Buhari highlighted the achievements of the APC government in the past three and half years; made presentation of the documented achievements and subsequently, presented the campaign mantra, signifying The NEXT LEVEL 2019. The President further directed APC members to commence campaigns across the country.
There was no goodwill message from the national leader. However, Tinubu was said to have traveled overseas and was not in the country at the time of the campaign launch. More so, Tuinubu’s closest ally in the South West, Governor Rauf Aregbesola of Osun State, was also absent at the opening campaign.
