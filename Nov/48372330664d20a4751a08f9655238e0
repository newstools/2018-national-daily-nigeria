Akwa United central defender and captain, Emmanuel Ariwachukwu who under went his medicals recently after agreeing a deal with Sudanese Giants, Al-Hilal Omdurman has described the move as a step further in his career and not the final destination.

Ariwachukwu  told National Daily that he is taking a step further in his career even if it is the Sudanese league, the opportunity to play outside the country was too good to turn down.

The Akwa United Skipper explained that although playing in Europe was still his long term career goal,  starting his overseas career in the Sudanese league was not a bad one for him and his career because it represents a step up from placing in the Nigeria Professional Football League.

Speaking to National Daily on his plans playing for Al-Hilal, he said, “I will justify my signing by doing my best and ensuring within a short period of time I will leave for central Europe.”

He said,  “I am not surprised that it came at this time because I put a lot of hard work in the just concluded NPFL season and in the previous season as well.”
