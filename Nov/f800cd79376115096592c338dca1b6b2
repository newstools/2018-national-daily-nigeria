Barcelona great Xavi believes there is no chance Neymar will rejoin the LaLiga champions in the near future.
Neymar is in his second season at Paris Saint-Germain after leaving Camp Nou in 2017, but the 26-year-old is already linked with a return to Barca.
The Brazil star reportedly met with Andre Cury, an advisor to Barca in terms of signings, during the international break.
But Xavi – who won eight LaLiga titles and four Champions Leagues at Barca – dismissed any suggestions Neymar could complete a move to his former club.
“I don’t see it. I don’t see it. I also think it didn’t work out well, I don’t see it in any way,” Xavi told Cadena SER on Thursday.
“I read a lot of press because I’m up to date with everything football, but I see zero chances that Neymar can return to Barcelona.”
Neymar has scored 13 goals in 16 games for PSG this season as he enjoys another prolific campaign with the Ligue 1 powerhouse.
