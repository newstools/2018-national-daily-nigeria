The APC guber candidate in Imo, Sen. Hope Uzodinma, has been arrested by the Special Presidential Investigation Panel For Recovery of Public Property.
He was nabbed Sunday at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport in Abuja—after a year of evading arrest
Okoi Obono-Obla, chairman of the panel, said on Sunday that the panel arrested Uzodinma for the failure of his company to execute a contract of $12m for the dredging of Calabar channel.
The contract was awarded by Nigerian Ports Authority.
“The panel is investigating economic sabotage against Senator Uzodinma arising out of the failure of his company to execute a contract of $12m for the dredging of Calabar channel awarded by the NPA,” Obono-Obla.
The senator’s name has been published by INEC as the ruling party candidate in Imo where the incumbent Gov. Rochas Okorocha is battling to install his son-in-law.
