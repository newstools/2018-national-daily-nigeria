Submits Tonye as gov candidate in Rivers




The All Progressives Congress (APC) in its final list of candidates for the 2019 general elections, defied the judgment of the Supreme Court which nullified the primary elections conducted by the party in Rivers State as the party included Tonye Cole in its list of candidates submitted to the INEC.
APC in a statement the National Publicity Secretary, Lanre Issa-Onilu on the interpretation of the Supreme Court judgment had argued: “In view of conflicting interpretations that have greeted the recent verdict of the Supreme Court on the contention among our members in Rivers State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC), it has become necessary to clarify that the Supreme Court’s verdict has nothing to do with the primaries conducted for the governorship and legislative positions in the state.
“Therefore, the candidature of Arch. Tonye Cole along with his running mate, Hon. Victor Giadom remains inviolate. The list of our candidates for the governorship, National Assembly, and House of Assembly have been processed by the National Working Committee (NWC) according to the INEC guidelines.
“Our party appreciates the support of the good people of Rivers State and their commitment towards the victory of our governorship candidate, Arch. Tonye Cole and other APC candidates at all levels in the 2019 elections.
“A progressive leadership under the APC beckons and the people of Rivers State are poised to effect a change to move the beleaguered state to a path of progress and development.”
Senator Magnus Abe had challenged the APC leadership in Rivers State in court which got to the Supreme Court over the activities of a faction of the party controlled by Rotimi Amaechi.
