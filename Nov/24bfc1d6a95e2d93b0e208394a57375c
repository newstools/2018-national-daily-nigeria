Arsenal are reportedly mulling over a possible move for Real Madrid midfielder Isco.
Speculation emerged earlier today suggesting that the Spain international is desperate to leave the Bernabeu, having fallen out of favour with new Real Madrid boss Santiago Solari.
Isco has played the full 90 minutes of a La Liga game on just one occasion so far this season and is rumoured to have grown increasingly frustrated with the amount of game time he is receiving.
Spanish outlet Don Balon reports that Arsenal are one of the clubs monitoring his situation as they consider potential replacements for Aaron Ramsey, who is out of contract next summer.
However, the Gunners are expected to face competition for the 26-year-old’s signature from Italian clubs Napoli and AC Milan.
Real Madrid’s asking price could also prove to be a sticking point in negotiations, with the European champions thought to be holding out for a €70m (£61.9m) bid.
