Edinson Cavani, forward of Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) and Uruguay, said in statements to Radio Montecarlo channel in Uruguay that it is difficult to share the lead with players like Kylian Mbappé and Neymar. “We have three players who are technically important and it is normal that we all want to score. The coach’s role is to connect his players, in attack and also with defense. Tuchel has spoken with us, sometimes he does, but I think it is not easy and we can not continue, “said Cavani.
The Uruguayan striker, PSG’s top scorer (with 176 goals), said: “You know it’s not easy for the coach, but I think everyone’s work will be successful little by little. We will all be able to understand what is best, what can be done by the team and succeed together to win important things. You have to put the qualities at the service of the team. That way we can do great things. As soon as we understand, we can do many, because that way we can not continue “.
Of the trident of attack of PSG, Cavani is the only one who is not injured. Neymar suffered playing with Brazil against Cameroon an elongation in the adductors. Mbappé, a bruise on the shoulder in France’s friendly against Uruguay. Regarding the entry he made to Neymar in the trial against Brazil, Cavani said it was just a gambling action. “These are things that happen in football. We are friends, brothers. But you want to win and defend your team. I did not do anything, I did not touch him, I went to see him and I told him I had not touched him, only that, “were the words of the Uruguayan striker. The PSG receives this Saturday in Ligue 1 to Toulouse.
