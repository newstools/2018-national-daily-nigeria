The APC national chairman Adams Oshiomhole was detained by the Department of State Services (DSS) on Sunday.
He was interrogated by operatives for nine hours after some following allegations by some APC governors that he received bribes during the party’s primary elections across the country.
The APC chairman, according to TheCable, was asked to resign during the interrogation.
But he was said to have resisted the pressure.
He said he would only do so if he loses the confidence of President Muhammadu Buhari.
The APC chairman told the DSS that the president was in the loop of every action he took during the party’s primaries.
“Adams Oshiomhole was arrested by the DSS, they didn’t show him any petition. It was alleged by some governors that he collected bribe during the primaries,” a source was quoted as saying by the online publication.
“He was told to resign and he told DSS operatives that he will resign if he loses the confidence of the president. He said everything the party did, he (Buhari) was in the know.”
Quoting another source, the report said the president expressed shock at the governors’ move, saying he was not aware of the development.
“On Monday night Oshiomhole met with the president and briefed him on what happened and the president was shocked. The president said he did not know about it and promised to look into it,” the source said.
The ruling party has been bogged in crisis since it went through its primaries where many were disappointed, including governors, senators, and reps.
Amongst the affected governors who lost one way or the others are Imo’s Rochas Okorocha, Ondo’s Rotimi Akeredolu, Zamafara Abdulateef Yari, and Ogun’s Ibikunle Amosun.
