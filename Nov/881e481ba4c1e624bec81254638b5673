*1  Ryan Giggs*
The Welshman is adored by Manchester United fans after winning 34 trophies during his playing days at Old Trafford, including 13 Premier Leagues, two Champions Leagues and four FA Cups. Giggs is famous for having played almost his entire career under Sir Alex Ferguson and eventually took over as interim manager after David Moyes was sacked in 2014. His most famous goal was a late winner against Arsenal in the semi-final of the 1999 FA Cup, and United would go onto win the treble that year.



*2  Paolo Maldini*
During a 25-year association with AC Milan, Maldini built up a reputation as one of the world’s most consistent defenders.  After winning seven league titles and amassing 902 appearances, he finally hung up his boots in 2009 and Milan retired the No. 3 shirt in his honour.
*3  Jimmy Dickinson*
Playing on the left of midfield or at left back, Dickinson is one of the most famous Portsmouth players ever. He featured for the south coast club in the First, Second and Third Divisions between 1946 and 1965, and Pompey are also the only team he ever managed.
*4  Bobby Charlton*
Although he is one of many Manchester United players on this list, Charlton is probably the most adored by United fans. He racked up 249 goals in 758 appearances, a record that stood until Wayne Rooney broke it in 2017.  Charlton won three league titles and one European Cup during his time at Old Trafford, having survived the Munich air disaster in 1958.
*5  Paul Scholes*
Scholes has been admired as one of the best midfielders ever by greats such as Xavi, Andres Iniesta and Zinedine Zidane. The midfielder lifted 11 Premier Leagues and two Champions Leagues for Manchester United. Although he briefly retired in 2011, Scholes returned for a second spell at Old Trafford but finally ended his playing days in 2013 having spent his entire career under Sir Alex Ferguson’s reign.
*6  Tony Adams*
Known for his ruthless leadership and formidable defending, Adams is one of the most iconic Arsenal players of all time. He won four league titles and three FA Cups, captaining the Gunners during one of their most successful periods in the 1990s and early 2000s.
*7  Jamie Carragher*
Although he grew up an Everton fan, Carragher became a club legend at Liverpool during his 17-year professional career. The highlight of the defender’s time at Anfield came in 2005 when he tasted Champions League success after beating AC Milan on penalties in a dramatic final in Istanbul.
*8  Jack Charlton*
Bobby’s brother Jack was also a member of the winning 1966 England World Cup team, and spent his entire club career at Leeds United. A no-nonsense defender, Charlton played 773 times for the Yorkshire club and gained promotion from the Second Division in 1964 before winning the First Division in 1969.
*9  Gary Neville*
Another member of the Class of ’92, Neville was renowned for his consistency at right-back during Sir Alex Ferguson’s reign. He was one of the dominant figures in the Manchester United and England dressing rooms and captained the Reds for five years. He retired in 2011.
*10  Lionel Messi*
With five Ballons d’Or, nine La Liga titles and four Champions Leagues, Messi is one of the greatest players to have ever played the game. He was the star man of Pep Guardiola’s formidable Barcelona team between 2008 and 2012 and has battled with Cristiano Ronaldo for recognition as the world’s best footballer throughout his career.
*11  Francesco Totti*
Totti spent a quarter of a century playing for Roma, winning one Serie A title and two Coppa Italias. The striker once said: “I’ve cheated on all the girlfriends I’ve ever had but I would never cheat on Roma.”
*Paul Madeley*
Madeley was used in a number of positions during the most successful spell in Leeds United’s history in the 1960s and 1970s, and has often been described as the ultimate utility player. He played in the Cup Winners’ Cup final in 1973 and the European Cup final in 1975 and retired in 1980 after 17 years at Elland Road.
*13  Billy McNeill*
McNeill was the Celtic captain to lift the European Cup in 1967 and spent his entire career at Parkhead.  He was a hard-tackling defender and racked up 790 appearances for Celtic between 1957-75.  That incredible record earned him a statue outside Celtic Park, showing him lifting the European trophy, which was erected in 2015.
*14  Carles Puyol*
Puyol captained Barcelona for a decade and won six La Liga titles with the club. He also lifted the Champions League on three occasions and the Copa del Rey twice during one of the most successful periods in Barca’s history.
*15  Sandro Mazzola*
An Inter Milan great, Mazzola found the net 160 times in 565 games for the Italian club between 1960-77. He won four league titles and two European Cups, scoring twice in the 1964 final against Real Madrid.
*16  Nat Lofthouse*
Lofthouse is remembered fondly in the North West, having scored 255 goals for Bolton Wanderers.  He netted twice in the 2-0 FA Cup final win over Manchester United in 1958 and has been honoured by a statue at the club’s new stadium.
*17  Billy Liddell*
Liddell’s career was interrupted by the Second World War, but his loyalty to Liverpool was fierce. Playing as a winger and a centre forward, he notched 228 goals in 534 games for the Reds and stayed at Anfield despite relegation to the Second Division in 1954.
*18  Billy Wright*
Wolves were the strongest team in England in the 1950s and Billy Wright was a key figure for the West Midlands club. He won three league titles between 1954-59 and was runner-up in the 1957 Ballon d’Or to Alfredo Di Stefano.
*19  Giuseppe Bergomi*
Another Italian great, Bergomi played for Inter Milan between 1979-99, racking up 756 games. As a towering centre-back, he won the UEFA Cup three times and turned down the chance to leave Inter on multiple occasions.
*20   Franco Baresi*
A 5’9″ defender, Baresi became captain of AC Milan at the age of 22 and lead the club during a sustained period of dominance.  Milan conceded just 14 times all season en route to the league title in 1988, and the club retired the No. 6 shirt when Baresi ended his playing career in 1997.
