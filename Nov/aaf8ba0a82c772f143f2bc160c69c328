As the probe of bribery allegation against Kano Gov. Abdulahi Ganduje underway, the contractor behind the videos has indicated willingness to testify before the state Assembly investigating the matter.
In a letter sent to the chairman of the investigative panel, through his lawyer Saeed Muhd Twada, the contractor said his allegation against Ganduje is personal.
He gives the House a number of conditions it must guarantee before he shows up.
One of the conditions is that all the video clips will be submitted to two experts for forensic analysis and report — one, a serving officer of the Department of State Services (DSS) and the other an expatriate, while their bills will be paid for by the state.
“That a Certified True Copy of the Report(s) prepared by the experts shall be made available to our client prior to his appearance,” the letter read.
“That our client has undertaken to surrender to the experts, the device used in capturing all the events in the video clips submitted and others yet to be submitted for discreet analysis and scrutiny.
“That all the proposed questions to be asked by the panel in the anticipated session shall not be more than TEN (10) and shall be forwarded to our client in advance.
“That the sitting be restricted to limited persons and that our client should be allowed to wear mask, bear pseudo name and receive protection from authorities for himself, family and business undertakings.”
The contractor also demanded that the panel must invite the governor, Jaafar Jaafar, publisher of Daily Nigerian newspaper, and one Aminu Daurawa.
Jaafar has always insisted that the videos are authentic.
The House invited the governor on Monday, but he did not show up.
His commissioner for information who represented him said the governor chose of one the options–sending a representative— the probe panel gave in their invitation.
