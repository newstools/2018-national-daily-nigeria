A Federal High Court sitting in the Federal Capital Territory, FCT, on Wednesday adjourned till March 5th, 2019, a case of financial misappropriation leveled against three NFF officials for diversion of N3.4b FIFA grant given to NFF in 2015 for the development of football in Nigeria.

Justice Peter Affen who presided over the case said that nation’s anti-graft agency, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC’s inability to provide five witnesses they promised to bring before the court on Wednesday  forced the adjournment till March next year.

He stated further that the adjournment is to allow the anti-graft agency have ample time to arrange the witnesses and prepare them to appear during the next sitting.

The EFCC had dragged the NFF to court over the diversion of N3.4b FIFA grant in 2015 for the development of the round leather game in Nigeria.

It will be recalled that the three NFF officials – Christopher Andekin, Rajan Zaka and Jafaru Mamza pleaded not guilty to the 5-count charge against them after they were finally brought before the court.
