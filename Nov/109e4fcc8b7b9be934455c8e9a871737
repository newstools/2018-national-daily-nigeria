APC’s national chairman Adams Oshiomhole made a surprise appearance at the Book launch of former President Goodluck Jonathan Tuesday, causing a slight disruption of the PDP-dominated event.
Oshiomhole also tagged along former Minority Leader Godswill Akpabio who recently defected to the APC.
The APC chairman and Jonathan have been hurling verbal missiles at each other lately.
Oshiomhole insists the Jonathan administration plundered the country, and Jonathan also thinks the APC chairman has problem upstairs.
The two parties also have been playing the ruling party-opposition game in such a way many thought leaders are asking them not to heat up the polity in the build up to the 2019 general election.
But at the event, Oshiomhole took the surprise further: he ensured that he had  photographs with the National Chairman of the PDP, Uche Secondus.
