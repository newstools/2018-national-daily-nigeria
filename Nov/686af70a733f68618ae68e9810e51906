President Muhammadu Buhari, Chairman of the Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Lake Chad Basin Commission (LCBC), convenes a consultation of Heads of State and Government of the LCBC on Thursday, on November 29, 2018, in Nâ€™Djamena, Chad,.
Femi Adesina, Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, in a statement in Abuja, explained that the one-day meeting will review the security situation in the areas affected by Boko Haram insurgency and adopt measures to enhance the capacity of the Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF) to meet the challenges of securing the areas.
The presidents of the LCBC member countries of Chad, Cameroon, Niger, and the Central African Republic were invited to the meeting. The President of Benin Republic, a troops-contributing country, was also invited to attend.
Adesina noted that the MNJTF and the national operations of the affected countries have appreciably degraded the capacity of Boko Haram terrorists, although the insurgents still retain the capacity to attack isolated targets in desperate search for supplies.
