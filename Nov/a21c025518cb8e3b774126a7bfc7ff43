The Spurs midfielder is eager for the club to get into their new White Hart Lane ground and away from the national stadium’s damaged pitch
Christian Eriksen is unhappy with the state of the Wembley pitch – and can’t wait to move into Tottenham’s new ground.
Spurs have been playing at the national stadium while the new White Hart Lane is under construction.
But the building schedule has overrun, meaning the Londoners cannot move in until at least the new year.
And issues with the Wembley playing surface have been causing frustrations in the meantime.
The stadium has hosted three NFL fixtures, plus Anthony Joshua’s world heavyweight title showdown with Alexander Povetkin, in recent months, leaving the pitch in a poor state.
“As a player, it’s not been up to normal standard,” Eriksen, 26, told The Sun. “Let’s be honest and say that. I think you have seen that. They knew that.
“We want to play on a better pitch than our training pitch, but sometimes the training pitch is better than the game pitch. It’s difficult.”
Tottenham should have already been in their state-of-the-art new stadium but construction issues put back their original September 15 move-in date.
The Dane added: “We know the same as the people in the press. We don’t really know when it will be finished. Hopefully it will be soon.
“People have seen pictures of the stadium and what it is going to look like – it’s going to be exceptional when we are finally in there.”
Fans are hopeful that Spurs’ clash with Manchester United on January 13 could be their opening fixture in the new ground.
But there are reports the builders need even more time with the north London derby against Arsenal on March 2 another potential curtain-raiser.
