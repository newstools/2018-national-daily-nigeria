Nigeria Super Eagles striker, Henry Onyekuru has been sued by a German lady, Melissa Krott, his baby mama for failing to make child support payments available.
National Daily learnt from a German newspaper,  that the Onyekuru is owing €11,000 in child support payments and has refused to pay up, even after a court ordered him to.
Melissa Krott, the child’s mother, was quoted as saying: “I met him via Instagram. I thought he was great. At some point we wrote, met. When he found out that I was pregnant, he did not want the child.
Speech was no longer possible. He closed me off everywhere.” Onyekuru is said to have accepted the paternity, but still hasn’t paid up.
Knott added: “Right after the breakup, he already had a new girlfriend with whom he also has a child, a little boy.”
