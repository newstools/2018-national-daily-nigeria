The three-time African Champions are currently on 1,427 points and will hope to improve on their position when the next FIFA World Ranking is released.

The big climbers in the ranking include the African quintet of Mozambique (117th, up 5), Angola (125th, up 5), Sudan (127th, up 8), Comoros (143rd, up 5) and Gambia (166th, up 7). The rise of Kosovo (131st, up 6) was also notable as it took them to their highest FiFA Ranking position to date.
