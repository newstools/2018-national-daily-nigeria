An aide to former President Goodluck has rubbished the comical ceremony pf WAEC cerificate presntation to President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday.
Reno Omokri, relying on a 2015 request made to the exam board headquarters in Ghana, maintained that the president has no WAEC certificate.
In his viral Facebook page, Omokri said even the Headquarters confirmed in 2015 that it had no record of Buhari as one who had written its exams.
“The Headquarters of The West African Examination Council (WAEC) is in Ghana. They are immune to political control by President Muhammadu Buhari,” Reno said in his post.
“In 2015, Move On Nigeria wrote WAEC Headquarters and they said they have no record of Buhari’s certificate. Also, University of Cambridge confirmed that they did not use the alphanumeric grading system in 1961 which appears in Buhari’s ‘certificate’. #RenosDarts”
This is the second time the certificate allegation will be raging–the first being 2014.
The military claimed then it was not in possession of Buhari’s WAEC certificate and other academic credentials.
But, Buhari, while submitting his document to INEC recently said all his academic credentials, including his WAEC certificate are with the Secretary of the military board.
The registrar of WAEC, Iyi Uwadiae, came from the WAEC headquarters in Ghana to present the attestation certificate to the President in his mini conference hall in Abuja.
After the presentation, the Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Mr. Femi Adesina, in a tweet, wrote, “WAEC presents attestation certificate and confirmation of school certificate result to President Buhari. What will the naysayers say next?”
Reno, however, kicked.
He also said that the University of Cambridge also confirmed that, as at 1961, that they did not use the alphanumeric grading system which is now found in the recent attestation certificate given to Buhari.
