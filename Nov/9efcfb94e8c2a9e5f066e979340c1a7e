As we count down to the general elections, we may need to go back to the campaign situation that led to this present administration.
You do remember how a mob of young men stormed and set fire to the country home of Senator Kabiru Ibrahim Gaya and the campaign office and poultry farm of politician Abdullahi Mahmud, located in the town of Gaya.
The politicians, who both were voted in with Buhariâ€™s All Progressives Congress (APC) party last year, had promised to improve on sputtering electricity, limited water supply and rampant unemployment.
Below are 10 of the campaign promises Buhari made before he was elected:
1. I will reduce fuel price to 45naira per liter.
2. There will be free education at all level.
3. I will pay 23million Nigerians 5,000 monthly.
4. I will increase minimum wage and place every graduate in salary for extra 1 year after their youth service.
5. One free meal (to include fruits) daily, for public primary school pupils.
6. I will revive all our refinery in my first one year in office and build more to produce more for our domestic consumption.
7. I will crush Boko Haram in my first 3 months in office.
8. Three million Jobs per year.
9. I will stop importation of refined products.
10. Stabilizing the naira.
