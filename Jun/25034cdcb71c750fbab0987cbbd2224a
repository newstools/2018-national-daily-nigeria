Bishop David Olaniyi Oyedepo , President of Living Faith Church Worldwide, otherwise known as Winners Chapel, at the week end, admonished  President Muhamadu Buhari  against any plot to islamise Nigeria under whatever guise. The Bishop told the Buhari administration to be conscious of every move and policies that could spore religious war in Nigeria. He frowned at the inclusion of Islamic studies, a culture peculiar to the Muslim community, in the Police training curriculum by the Buhari administration.
In his Sunday prophetic ministration at the gathering of Christian worshipers worldwide in Canaan Land Ota, Ogun State, Nigeria , Oyedepo declared: “The inclusion of Arabic studies in the recent Nigeria Police Force NPF recruitment Test is highly unacceptable.
“Some forces just want to score political marks by trying to impress the president and divide us as a people. This administration and all agents that want to divide us should be seriously warned as it’s too late to turn Nigeria into an Islamic State.”
The Bishop, therefore, advocated that the Nigeria Police recruitment Test to be rewritten and the Arabic studies eliminated.
“We, therefore,  reject the NPF recruitment Test and ask for it to be re-written without the inclusion of the Arabic Studies in it,” the Bishop advocated.
