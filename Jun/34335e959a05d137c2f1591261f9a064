The Police spokesperson noted that the suspects had been helping the Police in their investigations.
Onwuka had been standing trial in the court over his alleged involvement in murder, armed robbery and unlawful possession of firearms.
The various Biafra movements had issued stay-at-home order on Wednesday, May 30, 2018, in commemoration of the 51st anniversary of the declaration of the Republic of Biafra on May 30, 1967, by late Odumegwu Chukwuemeka Ojukwu.  The declaration subsequently, led to 30 months of Civil War in Nigeria, 1967 to January 1, 1970.
