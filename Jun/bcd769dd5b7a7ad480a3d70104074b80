t about 4.44pm, the convention chairman,Governor Badaru Abubakar, ordered the stoppage of voting, as well as further campaign by some other candidates. He threatened that candidates found campaigning at the convention venue would be disqualified. However, the suspension of voting was to enable the committee tidy up its records over the withdrawal of some candidates at the convention venue.  
Quite a number of candidates continued to withdraw from the race while voting was initially in progress. Some of the voting-in-progress affected certain candidates that have withdrawn from the contest. Thus, the committee needed to update their records.
Few minutes later, the chairman reopened voting for positions still open to competition. Governor Badaru, however, ordered that there should be no more voting for Deputy National Chairman, South, because it remained unopposed. He further declared the position of the national legal adviser, deputy national welfare secretary, etc, also unopposed, as contending candidates withdrew at the venue.
