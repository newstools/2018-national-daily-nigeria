Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba has spoken ahead of France’s possible meeting with Nigeria in the round of 16 of the FIFA World Cup.
Speaking at a press conference two days before their final Group C fixture against Denmark, Pogba said Nigeria will be a formidable opponent if they face the three-time African champions.
He also noted that Croatia are the form team heading into the final round of matches in Group D, and he believes any team they face in that group will be difficult.
France have already qualified for the knockout stages and will top the group if they don’t lose to Denmark.
