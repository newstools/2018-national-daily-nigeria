The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on Tuesday articulated that the All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship mega rally at the Olufemi Kayode Stadium, Ado-Ekiti, Ekiti State, was a theatrical show of failures.
PDP in a statement by the National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, declared: “PDP notes that speakers at the rally did not disclose any significant plan which the APC has for Ekiti State and her people, an indication that it has nothing except deceit and lies to offer the people.”
The party further declared: “Party stresses that the rhetoric that envelope the poorly attended rally centred on abusive tantrums against the person of Governor Ayodele Fayose rather than raising issues of development which the APC candidate, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, had always claimed to be his area of strength.
“This was evident as Dr. Fayemi could not even itemise his last achievements in office, if any, upon which he wanted to be re-elected.
“The Ekiti rally, therefore, ended as a political comic relief for the PDP as many of the APC gladiators at the rally attested to the fact that Ekiti had been transformed from her poorly developed status in 2014 when Fayemi ruled.
“Dr. Fayemi as ‘Ekiti Kete’ ought to have listened to the drumbeats of his invited guests as they spoke poorly of his tenure.
“If his (Fayemi’s) own guests could adjudged his tenure with such dismal illustrations, is it the Ekiti that he left in embarrassing debt in 2014 that will reward his failure with another term in office?
“PDP urges the people of Ekiti State to rally the people’s party ahead of the July 14 governorship election citing the huge development which the incumbent Governor, Ayodele Fayose has brought to bear across the entire state.”
