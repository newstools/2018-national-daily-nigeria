Gernot Rohr says his youthful Nigeria side will “stay humble” as they prepare to take on Argentina in a World Cup winner-takes-all encounter in Group D,National Daily learnt.
Ahmed Musa’s stunning second-half double sealed a 2-0 victory for Nigeria against Iceland, with Gylfi Sigurdsson missing a late penalty as Rohr’s side bounced back from defeat to Croatia.
Victory lifted Nigeria to second place behind already qualified Croatia and a point against Argentina could be enough to secure the Super Eagles a place in the last 16, while a win would guarantee progression.

“I said before the World Cup that we’re here to learn, too, and this team will be ready in 2022. This World Cup came too early but we have a good chance to win against Argentina.”
Nigeria switched to 3-5-2 for the Volgograd encounter, with John Obi Mikel – often played as an attacking midfielder – moving to a deeper role, while Victor Moses was utilised at wing-back, although Rohr acknowledged convincing the duo to alter their roles proved difficult.

“To get them to do this for their country, it wasn’t easy to convince them, but they did it well.”
