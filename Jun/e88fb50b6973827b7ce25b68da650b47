Super Eagles players and officials have commended the Amaju Pinnick-led board of the Nigeria Football Federation for the president’s magnanimity in ensuring the team’s historic appearance at the Russia 2018 World Cup,National Daily learnt.
A source in the Football Federation disclosed that, the Eagles team represented by one of its defenders, Kenneth Omeruo, was full of plaudits for the NFF president and his board.
Omeruo said in an official statement to Amaju Pinnick: “I want to thank you for everything you have done for the Super Eagles on the road to this World Cup, the Super Eagles were on a different level.
“Unlike the previous ones where we had to fight or threaten not to play, before we got paid, through your leadership, this issue became a thing of the past. And now I want to apologize on behalf of the team. I personally know you believed we would surprise the world and we couldn’t achieve it and for this I sincerely apologize.
But this is a journey we will always remember and it’s because you made it a journey that was worth it. Thank you sir and I pray, under your leadership, we will get an achievement that will shock the world,” Kenneth Omeruo said.
The source who preferred anonymity noted that, aside from the Eagles team, NFF staff and football stakeholders are happy with the NFF president.
He said, it is mischievous for anyone who is outside the system to say that the NFF president wanted to do everything relating to the 2018 World Cup all by himself when in the true sense he assigned top officers to handle all aspects of Nigeria’s participation in the World Cup.
“Persons were assigned to do these. The NFF staff who came to Russia are very happy with the president, so those who are saying the contrary is the figment of their own imagination,” the NFF source said.
