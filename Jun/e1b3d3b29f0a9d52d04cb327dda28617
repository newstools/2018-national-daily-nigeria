APC national leader Bola Tinubu has vowed to work for President Muhammadu Buhari for a second term in 2019 following the presidential declaration of the late MKO Abiola a Grand Commander of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.
The former governor of Lagos said at the investiture ceremony for Abiola on June 12.
Buhari has also declared June 12 when the late politician was said to have won the 1003 presidential election cancelled by then military ruler Ibrahim B, Babangida.
While the PDP and other opposition parties see the Buhari move as political, the June 12 activists and many, including families of Abiola, applauded the president.
Highlighting some of Buhari’s achievements, Tinubu said that Nigerians are no longer paying for darkness, giving an indication that electricity supply has become stable under the present administration.

He also lauded Buhari for the school feeding programme, a component of the government’s Social Investment Programme.
The APC leader has been adjudged the best strategists in the ruling party Buhari cannit do without in 2019–despite how frosty the relationship between the two had been before now.
