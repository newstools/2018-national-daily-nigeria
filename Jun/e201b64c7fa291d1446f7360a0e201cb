Chelsea manager Antonio Conte has rejected an approach from Real Madrid, according to Gianluca Di Marzio.
Though the Blues boss is unhappy with the Stamford Bridge outfit’s pursuit of someone to replace him without sacking him first, he is reluctant to resign with a year left on his contract.
Taking over from Zinedine Zidane at Santiago Bernabeu offered him a route out of west London, but Conte is unsure as to whether the current Madrid squad would be open to his intense coaching methods.
In other news, Arsenal have contacted Juventus about the availability of defenders Medhi Benatia and Daniele Rugani, according to  Calciomercato .
Rugani, 23, is seen as a key part of Juve’s future, and could be tough to pry away from Turin.
Benatia, however, is more likely to move after reportedly falling out with Juventus manager Max Allegri.
