The Department of State Services has arrested the Senator Eyinnaya Abaribe representing Abia South in the Senate.
He was nabbed in Abuja on Friday at a popular hotel located at Maitama District.
Nit much is known about the reason for the arrest for now.
But the senator is the surety for IPOB’s runaway leader Nnamdi Kanu facing trials for treason last year.
The presidency has insisted Abaribe knows Kanu’s whereabouts.
