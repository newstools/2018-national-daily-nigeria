The consequences of the All Progressives Congress (APC) holding its Saturday, June 23, 2018, national convention in Abuja, with unresolved crises, is beginning to unveil threatening political misfortunes or fortunes for the party.
The former Governor of Kano State, who delivered the highest figure of bloc votes to the APC and President Muhammadu Buhari, from Kano in the 2015 presidential election, Senator Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso, representing Kano Central in the National Assembly, has shown no sign of regret for not attending the APC convention in Abuja but preferred to spend same time holding consultative meeting with former Vice President Atiku Abubakar.
National Daily gathered that Kwankwaso, in a statement on Sunday, had no apology for his absence from the convention but rather protested that he resolved to ignore the convention because the leadership of the party failed to recognise his own faction of APC in Kano. He noted that he had wanted to be part of the national convention with his army of supporters but for the ill-treatment they received from the party leadership.
The former Governor had declared in the statement; “I wish to inform the leadership of the party and the general public that we had wanted to be part of the national convention but regrettably all the congresses that we conducted at the wards, local government councils and at the State level were not recognized by the outgoing national executive council of the party.
“Therefore, I felt that presenting ourselves at such an important event will not be in the overall interest of the entire convention that is assuming we are allowed access into the convention ground.
“Because there are high chances that our presence could create embarrassment and a lot of friction similar or even worse than what occurred in the pavilions of delegations from Imo and Delta states during yesterday’s convention.
“However, as the new EXCO settles to start the efforts of uniting the party we wish you the very best.”
Kwankwaso was at the residence of the former Vice President Atiku Abubakar at Asokoro, Abuja, holding a consultative meeting while the Saturday APC national convention where new leaders to man the National Working Committee (NWC) were elected was going on.
