Former FIFA president, Sepp Blatter, has said that Nigeria will be ‘trouble makers’ at the 2018 World Cup in Russia.
Blatter, who left FIFA under controversial circumstances, took to his verified Twitter account, to list out the teams he considers as favourites to win the tournament.
The Swiss picked Brazil, France, Germany and Spain (in alphabetical order) as his favourites, because of their attacking style.
Blatter however labelled Nigeria and Uruguay as “trouble makers”.
