Osun United Football Club have announced that Adebayo Adesina and his assistant coaches Kazeem Oseni and Gbenga Ajayi Obe, have been sacked with former team captain Waheed Olapade to take over on an interim basis,National Daily learnt.
Osun United announced Adesina’s firing on Saturday, minutes after a disappointing 1-1 home draw against Crown Football Club in one of the Week Seven (7) contest of the Bet9ja Nigeria National League.
Oseni, Obe and Adesina worked as assistants to former coach Duke Udi, before Adesina was elevated as team head coach before the ongoing season.
Pressure was on Adesina, with the Omoluabi Giants enduring an inconsistent start to the season losing 0-1 at home to Remo Stars in the first league match and Saturday’s home draw to Crown compounds the team woes.
The Omoluabi Giants under Elewele as Adesina is fondly called garnered five (5) points from possible eighteen (18) points with the team languishing at the bottom of the NNL Group B2 log.
Omo-Oba and Ajere will take charge of the team next game on Thursday away against Rovers FC at the UJ Esuene Stadium, Calabar after which a new coach will be appointed.
