Supporters of Jigawa’s former Governor Sule Lamido, and other residents were prevented from holding a special prayer session for their leader’s victory at the 2019 presidential polls.
Lamido is one of the aspirants in the PDP who has declared his presidential ambition on the platform of the opposition party. He is also a critic of President Muhammadu Buhari who is seen as the likely candidate of the rulong APC.
The prayer session scheduled to hold on Thursday at the Eid Ground, Dutse, the state capital, was aborted as the crowd were prevented by security personnel deployed to restrict movement into the venue.
The convener, Umar Danjani, told journalists on Thursday that the prayer was organised by “groups of students on foreign scholarship sponsored by the Lamido administration.”
Stability across the country was another reason for the prayer session.
“The security forces are doing their best but it seems that the situation is worsening day by day, as a result, Nigerians need to turn to God for divine intervention,” he said.
Reacting to the siege by the security operatives, he called on the police to imbibe the international standards on policing meant to safeguard the fundamental rights of all citizens not the interest of a few.
“The police invited me and I spent hours explaining to them our intentions for holding the prayer, they (police) suggested a venue for us which we all agreed. Unfortunately, later they called me and said we have to cancel the event citing an order from the above,” Danjani said.
“We even suggested to use the premises of the police headquarters for the prayers for maximum security, but later agreed for another venue different from the police premises.”
The session was to host all former commissioners and personal assistants that served under Mr Lamido’s administration.
