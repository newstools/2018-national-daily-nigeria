Nigerian musician, Eedris Abdulkareem has aimed heavy criticisms at former President Olusegun Obasanjo.
In a new song entitled ‘Letter To Obasanjo’, he said the retired general was the problem of Nigeria.
The controversial rapper also accused Obasanjo of corruption and killing the people of Odi in Bayelsa state in 1999. In an interview with Linda Ikeji, he said, “Obasanjo served as a military president and also a civilian president.
“He had the opportunity to correct the wrongs. He was selfish and wanted third term by all means.
“His administration recorded too many killings and assassinations. He’s very selfish and wanted to rule Nigeria forever.”
