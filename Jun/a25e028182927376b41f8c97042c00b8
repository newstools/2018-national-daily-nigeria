Former governor of Plateau state, Joshua Dariye, who was handed a 14-year jail term on Tuesday begged for mercy at the Federal Territory High Court where he was convicted.
He was said to have approached the lead counsel of the EFCC, Rotimi Jacob, begging him to have mercy, even blackmailing the erudite SAN with Christian sentiments.
“Have mercy, you are a Christian, your name is Jacob,” Dariye was quoted to have told Jacob.
Dariye was found guilty of 14 counts out of 23  preferred against him by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC).
He was said to have used an account belonging to Ebenezer Reitner Ventures, a company he owns, to divert ecological fund.
The account was domiciled in Sun Trust Bank
Before Adebukola Banjoko, the judge, gave her ruling, Paul Eroko, counsel to Dariye, pleaded for a light sentence.
“Appeals to your judgement do not succeed, we will fall on your mercy. The prisons are congested,” Eroko said.
“They misled the governor, it is the bank, they said he didn’t have to present anything.”
But Rotimi Jacobs, counsel to EFCC, said Dariye did not deserve a light sentence because he “didn’t show remorse”.
Jacob asked the court not to give Dariye a light sentence in order to serve as a deterrence to those holding public offices.
“He is not remorseful, his case should serve as a deterrence,” Jacobs said.
Dariye was whisked away by policemen after the judge ruled.
