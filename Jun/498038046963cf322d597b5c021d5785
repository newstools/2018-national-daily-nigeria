The nPDP bloc of the ruling APC may be sliding into irrelevance as indications abound the SDP is itching to replace the splinter group after the APC national convention on June 23.
But that mpve will equally rock the SDP led by former SGF Olu Falae, and probably pit him against Amb. Babagana Kingibe who is set to replace the Kawu Baraje-led nPDP with his own structure in the SDP.
Falae, many Nigerians know, is no fan of President Muhammadu Buhari whom Kingibe fawns on, and is eager to work for in 2019.
Besides, while Kingibe is a member of the old SDP, Falae is a latter-day member.The intervening years between their membership is another faultline analysts believe may split the party soon if there is no compromise.
Chances of compromising are, however, not far-fetched. Falae has insisted he has no personal grouse against Buhari though the president’s handling of Nigeria’s security has cost Falae a lot. His oil plantation in Ondo was burnt by suspected Fulani herdsmen this year, and he nearly lost his life twp years ago when the SDP and Afenifere leader was kidnapped by herdsmen.
Again, Falae had been hobnobbing with former President Olusegun Obasanjo whose Coalition for Nigeria Movement seeks to oust Buhari in 2019. The SDP was initially thought to be the political platform the CNM would use, and talks between Falae and Obasanjp went on for a while.
The African Democratic Party was however chosen above Falae’s SDP, thereby creating a rift between Falae and Obasanjo.
The fact that the SDP has never won any election makes it prey in the paw of bigger parties like the APC or PDP–since it needs relevance.
