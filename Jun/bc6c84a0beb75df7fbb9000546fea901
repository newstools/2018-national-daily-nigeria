Festus Keyamo, SAN, Director, Strategic Communications, President Muhammadu Buhari Campaign Organisation, Abuja, has decried the death of the Chairman of Punch Newspapers, Wale Aboderin, who passed on to the world beyond early Thursday morning in Lagos.
He sent his condolence to the family of the deceased and management and staff of Punch newspapers.
Keyamo remarked that the late Aboderin left a footprint that will be difficult to fill.
Keyamo, in a statement on Thursday evening, declared: “I just received with utter shock and disbelief the news of the passing away of Mr. Wale Aboderin, the Chairman of Punch Newspapers.
“Mr. Wale Aboderin, whom I usually call “my egbon”, was a close friend, a gentleman per excellence, kind, humble to a fault and extremely jovial.
“He graciously attended my party at the Civic Center, Lagos, sometime last year to celebrate my conferment of the rank of Senior Advocate of Nigeria.
“My deep condolences go to his immediate and extended family members, his friends and entire staff and management of Punch Newspapers.
“Nigeria as a whole has lost a rare gem at his prime, but we are all consoled by the fact that he left behind a very big shoe and indelible footprints that would be very difficult to fill or erase.”
Anoderin died at the age of 60 years.
