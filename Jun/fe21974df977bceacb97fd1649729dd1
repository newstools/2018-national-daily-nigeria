One of Africa’s most respected referees Gambian Bakary Papa Gassama says that VAR technology cannot eliminate every mistake made by match officials,National Daily learnt.
Gassama already has experience with the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) at last year’s Confederations Cup and will be able to use the technology again at the World Cup in Russia.
He says everyone from referees to fans is still learning about how to make the best use of the system.
.
“It is just like a new job: before you understand it, it will take some time. As time goes on, with this new technology, many referees and many VARs will understand better,”he said.
.
“That’s why, as a point of view, it is very important for the VAR to come as an extra eye, an extra help, because the VAR is also an experienced referee, like you on the pitch, to help in crucial situations.
“It is important for everybody, not only for referees, for players, for supporters, for everybody.
“It can eliminate all big mistakes, that is our aim – for VAR to come to eliminate all big mistakes, but VAR can not stop talking about football, no, no. That is practically impossible.
“Fifa has done a lot of seminars for us to be ready, to feel comfortable using VAR. Our aim as referees is to go to Russia and to have a very good tournament, as referees, VARs and assistant referees.
“Everybody knows the World Cup is the biggest stage, but all games, all competitions are important, so it is also challenging for us, being the first World Cup to try and do our best,” he added.
“That is why we are here, to try and do our best, to have a successful World Cup.
“As I said before, VAR didn’t come to stop all the talking in football, but we are trying to do our best as referees and assistant referees to eliminate scandal.”
