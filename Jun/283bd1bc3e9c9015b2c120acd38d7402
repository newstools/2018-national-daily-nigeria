Super Eagle winger, Alex Iwobi is excited with the arrival of new Gunners’ boss Unai Emery following the departure of former manager Arsene Wenger at the end of last season.
According to Iwobi’s write up in the Super Eagles’ matchday programme before Nigeria’s defeat by England’s Three Lions last weekend, the Russia 2018 bound winger revealed that he’s looking forward to work with the Spaniard who sealed a three-year contract with the Gunners after the World Cup.
“I was surprised by his (Wenger’s) decision,” wrote Iwobi.
“(Wenger) has been there for me since I joined the club and has been very inspirational and influential on my career, but I am excited having our new manager next season.
“It has always been my childhood dream [to play for Arsenal]. I have been playing for Arsenal since I was six.
“The fact I am representing them now is like a dream come true. I am always proud to wear the Arsenal colours, and long may it continue.”
