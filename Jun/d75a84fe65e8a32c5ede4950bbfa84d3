Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has revealed his desire to enter international management during his career.
The 47-year-old has excelled in club management with Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Manchester City, who he guided to the Premier League title in the 2017-18 season.
While he still sees his immediate future with City, Guardiola concedes that the lure of managing at a World Cup or European Championship might be too great to turn down at some point.

“In the following years, I want to stay where I am. But if someone wants me afterwards, I’m still young.”
Guardiola was speaking at the Kevin De Bruyne Cup, an international youth tournament in Belgium supported and named after the Manchester City midfielder.
