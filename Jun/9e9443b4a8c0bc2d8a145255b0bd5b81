APC bigwig Sen. Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso ignored his party’s national convention on Saturday, and paid a nightly courtesy visit to PDP’s presidential hopeful and ex-Vice President Atiku Abubakar at his residence in Asokoro, Abuja.
The former governor of Kano arrived at Atiku’s residence at 8.30pm and went into a closed-door meeting with the former vice president.
Although the details of their meeting was not made public, it was said to have lasted for about 45 minutes.
Why he boycotted his party’s national convention at the Eagles Square was not known yet.
But Kwankwaso has been having problems with his party at the state and national levels.
He is also believed to be one of the favourites former President Olusegun Obasanjo is planning to field in his Coalition for Nigeria Movement and ADC alliance come 2019 presidential election.
Though he has yet to defect, there are speculations that the former governor of Kano State is also planning to leave the APC–like Atiku did last November.
Media aide to Atiku, Mr. Paul Ibe, confirmed the visitation but didn’t disclose details of the meeting between Atiku and Kwankwaso.
