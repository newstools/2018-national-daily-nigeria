Former Governor of Abia State, Orji Uzor Kalu, has commended President Muhammadu Buhari for revisiting and addressing the injustices caused by the annulment of June 12, 1993, Presidential Election by the then military government. The former governor also commended the president on the posthumous acknowledgment and honour of Chief MKO Abiola as the winner of the freest and fairest election in the country.
Kalu said that Buhari has shown that he is a true democrat in the recognition of June 12, adding that the president also puts Abiola in the map of the world.
Kalu remarked that Buhari achieved the feat other presidents failed.

National Daily gathered that Orji Kalu was of the view that Buhari has compensated Nigerians who lost their lives during the struggle to actualize June 12 mandate by honouring Abiola and restoring June 12 as the country’s Democracy Day.
Kalu observed that the decision of Buhari to honour late Abiola with the highest national award in the country shows that he is a democrat the people can trust.
Kalu, however, advocated that Buhari should take a step further by honoring the Chairman of the National Electoral Commission (NEC), Prof Humphrey Nwosu , who superintended the elections.
Kalu further demanded that Buhari should also address the injustices people of the South East suffered during the Nigerian Civil War by declaring the region a special zone for federal intervention.
Such declaration, he said, would have finally addressed the problems the people of the region suffered which included loss of money and property.
