Germany marked an 80-year low in World Cup competition as they were sent packing from Russia 2018 in the first round,National Daily learnt.
The reigning champions picked up just three points in their first two outings in this latest edition of the tournament.
A shock 1-0 defeat to Mexico was followed by a 2-1 win over Sweden, with Toni Kroos’ last-minute free kick keeping their hopes alive.
But a 2-0 reverse against South Korea, coupled with Sweden’s 3-0 defeat of Mexico, means that Joachim Low’s men are on the way home from Russia.
Their miserable campaign was capped by a late humiliation, as Korea struck twice in stoppage time thanks to an inspired performance despite knowing Sweden’s win would also send them home from the World Cup.
Amazingly, it is the first time in eight decades that Germany have failed to make it past the opening round of World Cup competition.
In 1938, Germany were eliminated by Switzerland in a straight knock-out format in their first tie of the France-based competition.
