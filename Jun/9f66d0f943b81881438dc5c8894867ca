Vice President Yemi Osinbajo had an emergency landing Thursday at the Nigeria Customs Command and Staff College, Gwagwalada, Abuja, when the chopper conveying him from the venue began to flail and smoke mid air.
Osinbajo came in the same aircraft to the college on Thursday for the graduation ceremony of Senior Division Course 1/2018 participants.
Upon take-off after the ceremony, the white chopper with yellow and blue stripes could not ascend beyond the tree level before it started emitting thick fumes.
It quickly landed on the same spot a few seconds after take-off.
Osinbajo later left the college by road.
Laolu Akande, his media aide, later took to his verified Twitter handle, @akandeoj.
“VP Osinbajo attended the graduation ceremony of Nigeria Customs Senior Course in Gwagwalada today. On his way back it was decided, for technical reasons, not to fly the chopper that had brought him to the venue. He drove back to the Presidential Villa & continued his schedule,” Akande tweeted.
