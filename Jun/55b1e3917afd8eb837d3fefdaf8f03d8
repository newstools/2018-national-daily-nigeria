The Kano government has described the absence of Kano Senator Rabiu Kwankwaso at the APC national convention as the death knell of his political career.
Commissioner for Information, Comrade Mohammed Garba, on Monday in Kano lambasted the senator, describing the excuse for his absence as false.
Kwankwaso said he boycotted the convention because the immediate past APC national leadership did not recognise the Wards, Local Governments and State Congresses conducted in Kano.
But Garba said the Kano Congresses were adjudged the best recently conducted in the country as there was no case of parallel congress in the state.
He believes Kwankwaso would have used the occasion to reconcile with Governor Ganduje on the APC leadership in Kano â€” instead of keeping off.
Party leadership in Kano has driven Ganduje and his predecessor apart since 2015, and each has been swinging his clout in big political occasions like the party conventions.
