An APC stalwart in the southeast geo-political zone has said the embattled governor of Imo and APC Governors Forum Chairman Rochas Okorocha ciuld leave the party if he wants.
“At least, there are more than 60 political parties now, Okorocha is free to join any of his choice,” said Osita Okechuhwu while responding to questions from newsmen at the National Secretariat of the APC, in Abuja, on Monday
“Though we are not forcing him to leave, what we are saying is we have taken the leadership out of his hands because he was playing God.”
The governor of the only APC in the region appears to have hit a rough patch since he made a move to install his chief of staff and son-in-law as the party candidates for the next guber election.
Although he was before now a go-to guy in the east for Aso Rock, Okorocha has lost his charm with President Muhammadu Buhari. A meeting held between the Imo party leadership and V.P Yemi Osinbajo ended up in favour of the opposition against the governor.
Okorocha is not in good terms with the APC national chairman either. John Odigie-Oyegun believes the Imo APC leaders are being treated unfairly by Okorocha.
The Voice of Nigeria’s Director-General said the APC is now better positioned to make a greater impact on the South-East with or without the governor.
He believes that the APC would consolidate on its power come 2019 by winning seats at the executive and legislative levels in state and at the federal levels.
“Mr President is going to get more votes; we are going to win more parliamentary seats, more governorship seats without him.
But one of the conveners of the APC Restoration Coalition in Imo , Toe Ekechi, said Okechukwu was merely expressing a personal opinion by saying the governor could suit himself.
According to Ekechi, Okorocha is still the governor of Imo, and his support and contribution will be welcome for as long as he remains in the APC.
