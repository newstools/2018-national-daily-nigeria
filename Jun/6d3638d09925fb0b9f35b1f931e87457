The Code of Conduct Tribunal (CCT) has refuted reports that President Muhammadu Buhari has appointed or is considering appointing Justice Adebukola Banjoko to succeed Justice Danladi umar as Chairman of the Code of Conduct tribunal (CCT).
The CCT insisted that Justice Danladi Umar remains chairman of the Tribunal assigned with the responsibility of prosecuting public officers who contravene asset declaration codes in public offices in Nigeria.
It was earlier reported that President Muhammadu Buhari is considering appointing Justice Adebukola Banjoko as new CCT Chairperson to replace Danladi Umar.
However, CCT Head of Press and Public Relations, Ibraheem Alhassan, in Abuja, said that Justice Umar remains CCT chairman and in continuous performance of his duties, has fixed June 20 and 21 for trial of public officers from Bauchi and Kwara states, for allegedly violating various provisions of the Code of Conduct Bureau (CCB) Act.
The CCT Head of Press and Public Relations, Ibraheem Alhassan, contended that contrary to the report, the appointment and tenure of the justice and members of the Tribunal are guaranteed by the Constitution. He appealed to Nigerians to ignore the reports that Justice Danladi Umar has been, or may be, replaced by President Buhari with Justice Banjoko as CCT Chairman.
