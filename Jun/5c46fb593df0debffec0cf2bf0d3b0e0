Former President Olusegun Obasanjo has been described as the most hypocritical former leader of the country by attempting to hijack the movement for political change.
Nobel laureate, Professor Wole Soyinka stated this in Abuja on Friday at a dinner organised by the International Press Institute.
“Obasanjo has crossed the red line and I will launch a publication to expose him on July 3 at Freedom Park in Lagos,” Soyinka stated.
The professor said the former president is trying to hijack a recovery process he is least worthy to lead.
According to him, Obasanjo is not the right person to lead any movement for reform leadership in the country in 2019, and that his Coalition for Nigeria Movement must not be glorified.
He warned that Obasanjo’s Coalition for Nigerian Movement should not be glorified.
He said Obasanjo and other geriatric leaders of his generation should step aside and allow a new generation to lead the nation.
The publication, Soyinka said, has a Latin title meaning “Who watches the watchmen”.
“That publication is coming out simply because I will like to see new blood in governance in this nation and I think these corrupt and hypocritical geriatrics should stop recycling themselves and they should stop trying to co-opt their former cronies to take over the reigns of governance in this nation,”he said.
