Chijioke Akuneto’s 14th minute goal helped Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries FC to secure another victory over El-Kanemi Warriors on Monday in a Matchday 23 fixture of the Nigeria Professional Football League at the Agege Stadium after their away win against FC Ifeanyiubah in Nnewi last Sunday,National Daily learnt.
El-Kanemi Warriors started the game brightly, with Michael Ohanu injecting urgency to his team’s play. The former Kwara United man teed up Anthonio Dasusa, whose pot-shot from outside the box went wide in the first 10 minutes.
The hosts improved remarkably after El-Kanemi’s early dominance, with Onuwa Chukwuka adding bite to his team’s drive going forward. The pressure from the Olukoya Boys  eventually paid off in the 14th minute when Akuneto flicked home Stanley Okorom’s cross.
MFM FC tried to double their lead, with Nojeem Akinyemi going close on two occasions as the first-half ended 1-0.
MFM started the second-half with great intent, looking to add to the scoreline. Onuwa released Julius Oriyomi with a lovely defence-splitting pass in the 51st-minute, but the midfielder over-hit his effort in a one-on-one situation with El-Kanemi goalkeeper, George Michael.
El-Kanemi took charge of the game after that as they piled the pressure in search for an equaliser
Ohanu went close after weaving in between two MFM defenders before firing over the bar and substitute Afolabi Abdulwaheed long range went wide.
The Olukoya Boys still occupy the 11th spot on the log with 33 points from 24 games as we head for the 2018 World Cup break.
