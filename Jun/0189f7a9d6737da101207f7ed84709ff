A year after it stopped aircrafts belonging to Medview airline from operating in its airspace, the European Commission has not rescinded on its decision.

In the updated Air Safety List seen by National Daily, a total of 119 airlines are banned from flying to any European Union member country. However, all air carriers from Indonesia were cleared.

“Today the European Commission updated the EU Air Safety List, the list of airlines that do not meet international safety standards and are therefore subject to an operating ban or operational restrictions within the European Union,” the statement released recently read.

“Following today’s update, all airlines certified in Indonesia are cleared from the list, following further improvements to the aviation safety situation that was ascertained in the country.”

In 2017, it banned Medview aircraft because of unaddressed safety deficiencies.

“On the other hand, the airlines Med-View (Nigeria), Mustique Airways (St. Vincent and the Grenadines), Aviation Company Urga (Ukraine) and Air Zimbabwe (Zimbabwe) were added to the list due to unaddressed safety deficiencies that were detected by the European aviation safety agency during the assessment for a third country operator authorisation,” it said.

To continue operations on its Lagos-London route, the airline secured a wet lease from an EU-member state.
