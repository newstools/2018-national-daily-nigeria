Leicester City forward, Kelechi Iheanacho, is talking tough and upbeat about the Super Eagles’ chances of making it to the last sixteen when they face Argentina on Tuesday evening
The South Americans are on the brink of elimination from the World Cup after their humiliating 3-0 loss to Croatia on Thursday.
”They are a strong team as you know, we have played against them and we won, they wanted us to beat Iceland so that they come at us,” Iheanacho told reporters in the mixed zone.
”It is going to be a difficult game for them, we have to fight together and do everything possible to beat them in that game despite they have good players and are a quality side. We need to show them we are from Nigeria.”
