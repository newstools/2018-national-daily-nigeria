Presidential aspirant for the 2019 elections and publisher of Sahara Reproters, Omoyele Sowore, reopened his social diary where he revealed how the military were prevented from burying M.K.O. Abiola in 1998.
He stated that the  military wanted to bury  late Abiola but he joined in mobilising forces to stop the Nigerian military.
According to Sowore: “In 1998 after the “sudden death” of Bashorun Moshood Kashimawo Olawale Abiola’s the winner of the June 12 1993 election, a group of young people massed at his residence, Ikeja Lagos primarily to prevent the military from attending and conducting his burial. It was a great battle as some members of Chief Abiola’s family felt our siege was bad for business.
“However, we stood our ground insisting that nothing but a critical mass movement that had been the vanguard of the revalidation of the annulled election be allowed to conduct the historic burial. I stood in for thousands of of Nigerian youths at Abiola’s residence to deliver a speech announcing the burial of the Nigerian military and their brand of murderous politics. On this day, twenty years later, Nigerian youths will be holding a historic event in and around Chief Abiola’s house to mark June 12 as “Democracy Day.”
“It is time once again to bury the murderous old guards at the helm of affairs in Nigeria.
“It is Time to end the leadership of robbery, corruption, nepotism, fascism, inertia, incompetence, wickedness and selfishness!.”
Meanwhile, Sowore has intensified campaign across the country and in the international community, mobilising support to take back the Nigerian State in 2019 from the hegemonic elite that have ruined the country.
