Midfielder Oghenekaro Etebo has told National Daily that he is in good shape for Nigeria’s first game against Croatia in the 2018 FIFA World Cup.
The Stoke City new signing says he can’t wait for the Super Eagles to kickstart their campaign in Russia.
“The wait for the World Cup has been a long one because we all want to start playing these games,” the former Warri Wolves midfielder told Futbalgalore.com.
“Right now I feel physically good and strong. I’m most relaxed about the games and I’ll try to do my best.
“We have to worry about the Croats but not be surprised at anything. It’s true that it’s a complicated start but we have no choice.
“I feel proud that teams now play depending on how we do. But the past is useless and we are prepared for every game.
“This is a hard list to choose from for the Coach and the competition is good. If there’s more competition then there’s more on the field.
