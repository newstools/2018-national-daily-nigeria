For a team known for its mesmerizing brand of football and great attacking mentality, rare woeful defensive calamity nearly humiliated Nnewi United at home against Delta Force FC as they threw away the lead thrice in the encounter
While it was a very entertaining game for the neutrals, it was indeed a nervy one that had not just the Manager, Anayo Offor but all fans of United, eating their hats and biting their fingernails till the very end of the match
Even as lots of positives can be drawn from the game with regards to the strong mentality of the squad to keep getting its nose in front after being pegged back, it is clear that a lot of work needs to be done in the defensive department especially in keeping shape when the team is not with the ball
The game is historic as it marks the highest scoring match United has ever been involved in and also the highest scoring match in the Bet9ja NNL this season
In the end, the beautiful game of football won as both teams threw caution to the wind and went on an overload mode
Any doubters of football should be made to watch this classic in order to appreciate the beauty, suspense and ecstasy that comes with football
