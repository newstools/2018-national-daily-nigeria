Croatia coach, Zlatko Dalić has stated that the Super Eagles has only three fast players, ahead of his side’s clash with Nigeria in the 2018 World Cup in Russia.
Dalić, who did not name the three players, expects Gernot Rohr’s men to be a threat on the counter attack with the trio when they clash on Saturday in their World Cup opener at Kaliningrad Stadium.
He, however, believes the Eagles have the same playing style as Senegal, whom they beat in their last pre-World Cup friendly 2-1.
”It was a clean game, and that is what will be our game with Nigeria. They have firm formation and then open up in counter attacks with three fast players,” Dalic was quoted as saying by Sportske Novosti.
”We have to know what is waiting us and this was a good test for that. But, I say that we have to be better in some elements of the game.”
