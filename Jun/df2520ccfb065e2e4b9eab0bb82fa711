All-Share index a series of numbers which shows the changing average value of the share prices of all companies on a stock exchange, which is used as a measure of how well a market is performing.

This slight improvement could be attributed to the activities of bargain hunters on the NSE taking position in fundamentally sound stocks.

Similarly, the Market Capitalisation of listed equities on the Exchange leaped marginally by N63.425 billion or 0.453 per cent to close at N14.071 trillion.

Also, Analysts at Afrinvest Limited, a wealth advisory firm with focus in West Africa, stated that discerning investors are taking taking advantage of the attractive entry share prices in the market.

“Last week’s gains  was largely in line with expectations as positive performance was largely driven by bargain hunting in bellwethers following successive weeks and 11 consecutive days of losses,” the analysts stated.

“Hence, we believe the rebound in the market will be sustained in the coming week as investors continue to take advantage of existing attractive entry prices in fundamentally sound stocks,” they predicted.

Moreover, National Salt Company of Nigeria (NASCON) lead other share price gainers after adding N1.60 or 7.14 per cent to close at N24.

Diamond Bank increased by 10 kobo or 6.58 per cent as its shareholders warm up for Tuesday’s Annual General Meeting (AGM) even as Japaul Oil and Maritime Services sustained its rally, notching 2 kobo or 6.45 per cent.

A total of 30 equities gained on Monday even as 20 equities slipped to the laggards side.

Going by the prediction of Afrinvest analysts, the NSE is expected to consolidate on the gains it recorded Monday.
