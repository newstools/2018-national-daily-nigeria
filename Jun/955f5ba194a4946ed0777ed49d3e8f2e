Chelsea forward, Eden Hazard has sent a message to injured Egyptian winger, Mohamad Salah.
The Beigium forward said he hopes Salah will recover from the injury in time to make a big impact at the World Cup.
Salah is a major doubt for the tournament as a result of the shoulder injury he sustained during last month’s Champions League final.
Despite Salah insisting he is hopeful of participating in Russia, Egypt’s coach, Hector Cuper admits he is planning on being unable to utilise the 25-year-old’s goalscoring talents
Hazard scored as Belgium had a comfortable 3-0 win over Egypt in Wednesday’s World Cup warm-up friendly in Brussels and told On Sports that he hopes his former Chelsea teammate will be able to make it to his country’s first World Cup appearance since 1990.
Hazard said, “Salah is a friend and I wish he will recover before the World Cup.
“Egypt are a good team. They have many good players and I think they will perform well in the World Cup. Egypt are a compact team and they are very organised.”
