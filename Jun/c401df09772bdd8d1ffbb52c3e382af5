The Kogi State command of the Nigerian Police paraded a pastor, and two other church members who murdered a sex worker, Mercy Moses, for money ritual.
Pastor Segun Otaru and the three accomplices—Abdulmumini Yakubu, Samuel Segun and Mike Stephen (Now at large) of the Voice of Canailan Church, C and S, Ozuri, Adavi local government area in Kogi State—were among nine suspects the police paraded for various crimes.
The pastor along with the accomplices were said to have all slept with the victim, strangulated her, severed the hand, leg as well as the head and buried her body in his church.
Two of the suspects, Stephen and Yakubu, also slept with her dead body and thereafter roasted her hand and legs and mixed it with a lotion to drink in order to get rich.
The state Police Public Relations Officer, ASP William Aya, said the pastor through one of the hotel attendants in the town lured the sex worker to his house where they carried out the act.
Mercy was from Benue.
Three days after, when the sex worker was yet to return to the hotel, the attendant called the pastor, and later reported to the police in Adavi.
The case got to the police headquarters in Lokoja who quickly swung into action and arrested three of them, with one still at large.
Speaking with newsmen, the pastor and the accomplices confessed to the crime but blamed it on poverty.
On having sex with the dead body, Yakubu said they believed sleeping with a dead lady will save them from having vehicular accident, said the sex act felt the same with a living soul.
Police said they have launched a manhunt for the forth person, Mike Stephen and they will soon be charge to court.
