Party flag to hang at half mask across the country




The Opposition Political Party in Nigeria, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has declared seven days national mourning over the Sunday mass killings in Plateau State by Fulani herdsmen.
Accordingly, PDP National Working Committee (NWC) in a statement in Abuja by the National Publicity Secretary , Kola Ologbondiyan, declared seven-day mourning for victims of gruesome killings by marauders and bandits in Plateau State and other parts of the country.
Kola Ologbondiyan, in the statement indicated that the Opposition Party  directed that its flags at all its offices and formation at all levels across the country be flown at half-mast during the seven-day period, in honour of the victims.
The PDP urged the people of Plateau State to exercise their rights as global citizens, work with other public-spirited Nigerians and groups and take President Muhammadu Buhari and his government to the International Court of Justice at the Hague for acting helpless in the face of continuous mass killings and seeming genocide in the country.
The statement read in part: “The PDP firmly holds that the life of every Nigerian is sacred. All Nigerians must be protected whether they are Birom, Basange, Ebira, Tiv, Idoma, Hausa, Igbo, Fulani, Gbagyi, Yoruba or from any other tribe whatsoever.
“The fundamental duty of government all over the world is the protection of lives and we can no longer afford to continue to fold our hands while compatriots are daily hacked down by marauders.”
