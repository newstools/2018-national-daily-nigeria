The management of Buruj Sports Academy have challenged all the players that have been pencilled down to feature in the upcoming English Super Cup in Manchester to up their game or risk being dropped the eleventh hour to be replaced with more serious players.
CEO Salaudeen Waheed  told National Daily that there is no point taking players that are not ready to work hard so that they can be fit and ready for the challenge of such an important outing. He also added that the foreign scouts who will be on thebground will diligently observe the quality of every player on parade before the can be considered for trial.
Waheed explained that to maximise the opportunity, only players that that can be able to hold their own will make the final cut which means those who are already on the list must not rest on their oars.
Salaudeen said,  “We have the team list already but we won’t mind to drop any player who is not ready. The purpose of going is to expose the best possible and we must not engage in sentiment to achieve our purpose.
“We know some of the players may think I am there already but we are still watching them everyday. Any one among them who is not serious will be replaced with better options,” he said.
The English Super Cup where Buruj Sports Academy will participate as defending champions will hold between the end of July and early August
