Nigeria Pillar of Sports, Chief Donatus Agu Ejidike, J. P has hailed the players for their dedication and patriotism, but called for fortification of the national team with tongues wagging on the circumstances and officiating that led to the exit of the Nigerian Super Eagles at the on-going FIFA World Cup tagged Russia 2018.
The Nigeria Pillar of Sports, Ejidike told National Daily that football at international level is about managing intrigues and politics which the Nigeria football ruling authority and the technical mangers as well as the players should be cautious about.
Ejidike noted that even the ball handling by Rojo of Argentina may be ruled as not a penalty because the ball first touch him on the head , the impotent finishing by Odion Igalo in the vital area was a display of inaccuracy and deficiency.
Nigeria lost many begging chances which according to Ejidike exposed incompetence of Super Eagles attackers meaning that the department must be revitalized.
“The coach must build a stronger team, he must bring in players that will deliver at any slightest opportunity. We must look beyond now and build a virile squad that will win the African Cup of Nation as well as make a remarkable impact in the next World Cup in the year 2022.”
The sports philanthropist sounded that we should analyze critically Super Eagles performance and come up with technical report that will help to rebuild the team.
