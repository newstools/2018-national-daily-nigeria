A 60-year old man, Cletus Aguluka, has allegedly killed his daughter, Onyinye Aguluka, in her sleep.
The incident occurred at about 2 a.m on Friday in Osikwu Village Awgbu, Orumba North Council Area of Anambra.
According to Georgina Aguluka, wife of the suspect, trouble started when Cletus came home in the night, drunk and looked for his torchlight without success.
“The children told him that they don’t know where it was, and he pretended that all was well, only for him to wake up around 1 a.m, went inside his room, brought out a machete and stabbed the daughter,’’ she said.
She blamed the incident on her husband’s new found love for drinking.
Also speaking, Sabastine Aguluka, the suspect’s immediate younger brother, said his brother had been molesting people, especially members of his family including himself.
A witness said the suspect escaped through the window and took to his heels when men of the village vigilante group got to the house, after which they took the corpse to a morgue.
Haruna Mohammed, Police Public Relations Officer in Anambra, confirmed the incident to journalists in Awka.
“Yes, the incident happened on May 31 at about 0200 hrs, and the suspect was arrested yesterday (June 1).
“Investigation is ongoing, after which he would be charged to court,’’ he said.
