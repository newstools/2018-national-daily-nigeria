Shuns Saturday’s national convention





Senator Dino Melaye, representing Kogi West Senatorial District in the National Assembly on the platform of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), on Saturday, predicted the political obituary of the ruling party as he shunned the national convention of the party in Abuja.
National Daily observed that besides Melaye, other APC members leading the nPDP who include Senator Rabiu Kwankwaso and Kawu Baraje were also absent at the Saturday national convention where members of APC National Working Committee (NWC) were elected.
National Daily noted that Melaye, in a post on Instagram, described the Saturday APC national convention in Abuja as a joke; projecting that the “Congress is the beginning of the “political obituary” of the party.”
The Senator further cited a song by the late Afrobeat legend, Fela Anikulapo-Kuti, denoting the APC as a bad political party.
 “Happy to be away from the joke going on in Naija today, (Saturday);
“Political obituary of APC activated. Egbekegbe na bad society…beast of no nation…egbekegbe…” Melaye declared.
It is becoming obvious that APC has monumental conflicts to contend with in the post-convention period contrary to statements by APC leaders at the convention that media reports before the convention did not reflect the attendance which was not open to all party members but selected delegates of less than 20,000 party members.
