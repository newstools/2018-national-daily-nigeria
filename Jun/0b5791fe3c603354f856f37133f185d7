The gang leader of the April robbery at Offa, Kwara, has added a new angle to his confession that implicates Sen. President Bukola Saraki and Gov. Kwara Abdulfatah Ahmed kast week.


According to Ayoade Akinnibosun, the robbery attack was his group side job. Their core assignment for Saraki was largely unleashing political violence.


Akinnibosun and dozens of his gang member were busted in May by the Inspector General of Police Special Intelligence Group. And investigations by the police have linked the suspect to Sataki and his state governor who they claimed equipped and financed them a cell named the Good Boys.


Vehicles branded Saraki and bearing the state government particulars were recovered from the suspects, and their state government collaborators trying to conceal evidence. police said.


The Force headquarters invited Saraki on Monday for interrogation. But there were reports the invitation was changed to request for a written response from the No 3 citizen.


The office of the Senate president also claimed their principal forwarded his written response.


However, the police during the week insisted they never withdrew the invitation asking Saraki to appear at the Force headquarters in person.


Force Public Relations Officer, Jimoh Moshood,at a media briefing where he re-paraded the suspects, said Saraki, going by confessional statements obtained from the suspects, was culpable in the robbery and killings. So has a case to answer.


The invitation has generated political debates in the Senate and across the nation. The PDP says President Muhammadu Buhari is using the police to hunt his political enemies.


But the police authorities are resolute.


”The Nigeria Police Force will not be cowed or succumb to intimidation from any quarter in carrying out a thorough and discreet investigation into the Offa banks robbery where significant successes have been recorded,’ said Moshood.
