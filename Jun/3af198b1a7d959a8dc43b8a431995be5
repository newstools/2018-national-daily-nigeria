The All Progressives Congress in Ekiti on Saturday said it has suspended its gubernatorial campaign earlier scheduled to take off on Monday.
The suspension came as the police command in the state released the report of Friday’s shooting incident at the APC rally organised to welcome back to the state its flagbearer in the July 14 governorship election, Dr. Kayode Fayemi.
The chairman of the party in the state, Jide Awe, told newsmen in Ado-Ekiti that the postponement was due to the shooting incident.
According to Awe, the suspension will remain in place until the police can guarantee the safety of its gubernatorial candidate and other members of the party.
He insisted that Friday’s shooting was an attempt to take the life of Fayemi, with the bullet, however, hitting a former member of the House of Representatives, Mr. Opeyemi Bamidele.
Awe demanded a thorough investigation of the matter by the police, insisting that the outcome of the report must be made public.
But the police command in its situation report released on Saturday by its Public Relations Officer, DSP Caleb Chukwuemeka, said findings revealed that what happened was a case of accidental discharge on the part of a mobile police officer.
