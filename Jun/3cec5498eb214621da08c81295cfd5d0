The Department of State Services have arrested Bemue’s former Governor Gabriel Suswam with respect to the security situation in the state.
According to Channels TV, Suswam was arrested after Gov. Samuel Ortom petitioned the DSS, allegedly the ex-governor is planning to make Benue ungovernable.
The DSS had arrested Suswam in 2017, claiming it uncovered a large stash of arms and ammunition from a property allegedly belonging to him at number 44 Aguiyi Ironsi Way, Maitama-Abuja.
DSS spokesman Tony Opuiyo then said the DSS got information that some incriminating items were stashed in the boots of cars parked on Suswam’s premises.
Bemue has been thrown into violence since January 1.
The unabating spate of violence has made President Muhammadu Buhari deploy the armed forces in the state and the entire north-western region believed to be plagued by herdsmen violence
Military authorities however claim politicians are behind the kiliings, using the violent herdsmen as a cover.
