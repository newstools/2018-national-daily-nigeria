The Lagos State Police Command has offered a N1m reward to anybody that will tip them off on the identity of a masked lady who alleged that one Inspector Christopher Nabugwu was living above his pay grade.
In a video that went viral on social media, the unidentified woman alleged that Nabugwu was worth over N2bn in cash and assets, and that he owned pish cars, a building worth N250 million on 27 Remi Fani-Kayode Street, GRA, Ikeja.
Lagos State Police Public Relations Officer, CSP Chike Oti, on Sunday said the allegations caught the attention of IGP Ibrahim Idris, and he ordered an investigation into the allegation.
“Investigation into the matter was painstakingly carried out. At the end of the probe, it was clear that the allegations were not only false and misleading, but a calculated attempt to malign the name of a hard-working police officer and embarrass the police authorities,” said Oti.
Commissioner of Police Edgal Imohimi, Oti said, appeals to Lagosians and Nigerians to offer information that will lead to the arrest of the masked woman.
