The Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, has finally sacked Prof. Richard Akindele who demanded sex from a student, Monica Osagie, to upgrade her mark.
Vice-Chancellor Eyitope Ogunbodede announced the sacking at a press conference in Ile-Ife on Wednesday.
Ogunbodede said the Governing Council of the institution sacked the lecturer, “having found him guilty of all the charges against him.”
The decision came after months-long investigation by the school authorities, and the intervention of the National Assembly.
