Kylian Mbappe was forced to limp out of France’s open training session on Tuesday with an apparent injury problem,National Daily learnt.
Mbappe, the Paris Saint-Germain superstar, is set to feature in his first international tournament with Les Bleus, having made his senior debut for Didier Deschamps’ side last year.
However, a clash with Adil Rami, the defender, left Mbappe on the floor and forced him to limp out of the training match.
Mbappe was set to start the tournament in France’s starting XI, alongside Antoine Griezmann and Olivier Giroud in a 4-4-3 system. The teenage starlet could also play in Deschamps’ favoured 4-4-2 formation, either alongside Giroud in attack or in the wide positions.
France are regarded as one of the favourites for this summer’s tournament, and they get their campaign underway on Saturday against Australia, before playing Peru and Denmark in the remaining Group C fixtures.
