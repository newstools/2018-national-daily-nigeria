Paul Pogba has hit back at critics who have questioned his style of play and off the field actions, arguing it would be no different than slamming Lionel Messi for “walking” on the pitch.
Ahead of the 2018 World Cup, where France are one of the pre-tournament favourites, Pogba has defended his style and flair, arguing not only has he done the same things during his periods of success, but also likening it to someone criticising Messi for not appearing to run enough on the field.
“I’ve always been like that,” Pogba said. “When I’ve won, I’ve won being like that. That’s my style of play. You’re not going to criticise Messi when he walks on the park. If he scores three goals are you going to say: ‘Ah but he’s walking on the pitch?’ No. You can’t tell me how to play. If I’m here today, it’s as I am. No one has told me how I must behave. That’s my football, that’s all.”
