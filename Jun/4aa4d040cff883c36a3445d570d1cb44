The Nigerian Air Force conducted air strikes on no fewer three Benue communities on Saturday, according to NAF Director of Public Relations and Information, Air Vice Marshal Olatokunbo Adesanya.
The operation lasted hours.
Adesanya said that it was an ongoing operation whose details he could not reveal for now.
“It is true that the NAF aircraft are involved in an operation together with other security services in Katsina-Ala. But the operation is still ongoing and I cannot disclose further details.”
The air strikes were carried out along the Katsina-Ala to Zaki Biam and Wukari Road, affecting Gbise, Ayaka and others.
But villagers believe the operation could be a reprisal on hoodlums in the communities.
The Commander of the Nigerian Army Engineering Corps, Maj Gen John Malu, was attacked recently by men dressed in camouflage in his hometown in Tse Adoor, Tiir Ward, Tongov in the Katsina-Ala LGA of Benue
Casualties figures could not be verified yet because military sources said the operations could last till Sunday.
Benue has come under attacks since January 1. Violent incidents in rural state have claimed hundreds of lives.
