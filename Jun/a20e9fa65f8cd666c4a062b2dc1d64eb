The Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) have sealed off premises of two companies for failure to pay taxes.
The FIRS Enforcement team, led by the Assistant Manager (Legal), FIRS, Ruth Mandeun, sealed Giandan Nigeria Limited, situated at 21 Ladoke Akintola Street, Ikeja GRA, over tax debts totalling N47.779 million. It also sealed Justeen International Limited over a tax debt of N24.779 million.
Speaking after the exercise, Mandeun said the defaulting companies will be re-opened only after they have cleared their arrears.
“It is quite upsetting for us to close down companies, but we just have to perform our lawful mandate. The two companies that were closed down today clearly defaulted in paying their taxes and they are fully aware of the repercussions.
“They will get to be reopened, but that is after they have cleared up their debts”, Mandeun said.
She added that the FIRS is committed to ensuring that all individuals and corporate entities pay their taxes promptly.
