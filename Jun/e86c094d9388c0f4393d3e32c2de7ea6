The 2018 World Cup represented the last chance for Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi to add the biggest and best trophy in football to their incredible collection.
While Ronaldo has scored four goals in Portugal’s opening two matches, Lionel Messi’s Argentina are on the brink of elimination.
Messi missed a penalty as Argentina drew their first match against Iceland 1-1.
Then, the five-time Ballon d’Or winner was anonymous as Jorge Sampaoli’s side were thrashed 3-0 by Croatia.
Even beating Nigeria next week might not be enough to qualify.
How can this happen to a side that boasts the likes of Sergio Aguero, Angel di Maria and Messi?
But not even Messi could bail his nation out of this one.
Maybe the pressure of having the weight of an entire country on his shoulders is proving too much.
That certainly seemed the case during the national anthem with Messi looking extremely stressed before kick-off.
And his sulking continued on the pitch.
Messi is considered a relatively calm person and rarely shows his emotions both on and off the pitch.
However, he couldn’t contain that in the 73rd-minute when he clashed with Ivan Strinić.
Strinić fouled Messi and the superstar really take too kindly to it. He stood up and, with his opponent on the floor, pushed him hard to show his displeasure.
