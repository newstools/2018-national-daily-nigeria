Victor Moses has returned to Nigeria squad on Thursday after taking some time off to celebrate a second honeymoon following his FA Cup final win with Chelsea.
The forward arrived at the team’s  camp  before the rest of the squad touched down from Nigeria ahead of their friendly game against England at Wembley on Saturday.
The 2013 Africa Cup of  Nations winner did not feature in the 1-1 against DR Congo in a friendly affair in Port Harcourt on Monday, and  Nigeria  coach Gernot Rohr and team are delighted to  have the player who was instrumental in the Super Eagles’ World Cup qualification in camp for Saturday’s match.
According to Super Eagles coach, Gernot Rohr, Moses had asked for an extended break to spend time with his wife.
“After the FA Cup Final, he told me it was the first anniversary of his wedding and if I could give him two days to celebrate,” the German coach began. “I said no problem.”
Moses joins the rest of the team for their first training session in England on Thursday at The Hive, home of Barnet.
