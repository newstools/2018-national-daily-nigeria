The heated argument during the special congress was the provision for a joint ticket during the presidential and vice-presidential elections.
Chief Dr, Jonathan Nnaji has argued against the addition of the provision.
“None of the Olympic sports use this method. The election to be President and Vice President should stand on its own. Even though we want to replicate the country’s methods, it is not right in sports”
