Ex-Eagles goalkeeper, Vincent Enyeama, has commended the team and urged Coach Gernot Rohr to build the side for the future after their heartbreaking exit from the Russia 2018 World Cup on Tuesday.
A 2-1 loss to Argentina in the last group D game at Saint Petersburg stadium sent the team to a third place with three points behind their South American counterparts with four points.
Argentina scraped through to the Round of 16 after Lionel Messi broke his drought at the tournament to give the two-time world champions the lead in the 13th minute.
It was the fifth time the Nigeria team was losing to Argentina at the World Cup.
Victor Moses restored parity for the Super Eagles from the spot after Javier Mascherano was adjudged to have fouled Leon Balogun in the box.
Marcos Rojo scored a stunning late winner three minutes from time to send Jorge Sampaoli’s side to the next round.
However, reacting on Twitter, Enyeama wrote, “Naija forever. Win or lose. Qualify or eliminated.#WeAreNigeria we build for better days.”
