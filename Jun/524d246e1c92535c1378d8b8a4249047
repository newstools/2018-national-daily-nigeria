Former President Olusegun Obasanjo on Wednesday paid a condolence visit to Plateau State where called on the Federal Government to properly investigate the massacre of over 100 persons in the State.
Dr. Obasanjo, .meeting Governor Simon Lalong, advocated that it is important to inquire into the immediate causes of the attacks in order to prevent further attacks and killings. He emphasised that he expects the Federal Government to work with the state government, local government and community leaders.
“We should find out the true cause of this. There must be a cause or causes – remote and immediate. If we are going to deal with it and we are not going to continue to multiply condolence visits by condolence visits, we must find out the root cause and deal with it.
“I believe that every human problem must have a human solution. This is a human problem,” Obasanjo declared.
Governor Simon Lalong, on his part, described the attacks and killings as very unfortunate but added that he believes the right steps have been taken to maintain law and order in the state.
“If there is peace in Plateau State, everybody will be very happy. But the moment the peace is threatened in Plateau; many other places will be threatened.
“We have done our best within this short period; we have learned our lessons and we are doing our best to maintain the peace. Like you said, we need peace not only in Plateau but all over the country,” the governor said.
