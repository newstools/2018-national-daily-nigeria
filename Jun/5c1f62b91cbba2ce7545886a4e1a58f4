After much expectation, the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA) has taken delivery of its multi- million dollar floating dock.

Head of Communications, NIMASA, Isichei Osamgbi, confirmed the arrival of the dock to the press recently.

The floating dock project, initiated by NIMASA in 2014, was aimed at ensuring that ships of various sizes calling at Nigerian ports repair their vessels in the country and thus help save the country from capital flights as a result of dry docking vessels outside the country.

According to the President of the Ship Owners Association of Nigeria (SOAN), Engr. Greg Ogbeifun, Nigeria is losing up to N180 billion annually to neighbouring countries due to lack of ship repair yards in the country.
