Meanwhile, the money market rates appreciated by 0.20 percent on Tuesday, with system liquidity (estimated at N200 billion positive) skewed towards a fewer number of banks.

The rates were expected to be relatively flat on Wednesday, June 27, but to trend slightly lower in subsequent sessions due to expected inflows from FAAC and OMO maturities on Thursday and Friday.
