Again, the report showed that all other indices finished higher with the exception of the NSE Insurance and NSE Oil/Gas Indices that depreciated by 0.61 per cent and 1.34 per cent respectively, while the NSE Alternative Securities Market(ASeM) Index closed flat.

Expectations for coming week:
The coming week is expected to continue with the profit-taking by investors, which began on the last trading day of the week under review (Friday June 8, 2018), analysts at Afrinvest Limited,  predicted.
Recall that the Daily Official list of the NSE on Friday showed that the NSE All-Share index and the Market Capitalisation dipped by 0.96 per cent each to settle at 38,669.23 basis points (bps) and N14.008 trillion respectively, precipitated by profit-taking.

Profit taking is the act of selling stocks to take advantage of a sharp rise in the stock price.

“In the coming week, we expect to see sustained profit taking in early trades, however, we believe this negative trend will be reversed before the end of the week on account of bargain hunting by investors,” Afrinvest analysts noted.

Selling off shares often causes share price decline, at least temporarily and profit taking is witnessed when there is an upward trend in the overall market.

Recall that the Chief Relationship Officer at Foresight Securities and Investment limited, Charles Fakrogha had earlier in the week stated that the rally on the stocks will not be sustained because of lack of strong fundamentals to back it up.

“This rebound, this trend, is not going to be sustained for a very long time because there are no strong fundamentals to support what we’re experiencing in the market. It is just an issue of frequent buying and selling; that’s what we’re experiencing in the market today. However, as we begin to approach the end of the second quarter, maybe some investors are positioning themselves,” he disclosed.
