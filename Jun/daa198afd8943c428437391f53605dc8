The Chief Olusegun Obasanjo-backed African Democratic Congress, ADC, has set July as the deadline to conclude talks with all parties interested in collaborating with it ahead of the 2019 general elections.
National Chairman of the party, Chief Ralph Nwosu, who disclosed this at a briefing in Abuja yesterday, faulted the All Progressives Congress, APC, for what he described as its reign of deceits, lies and propaganda.
“We have set July deadline to conclude all negotiations with all interested parties,” he said.
“I am sure all well-meaning players will see the sense in our insistence in having something new and refreshingly different and exciting and also be willing to align their parties to the ADC’s guiding principles,” he added.
At the event, Dr. Chuks Okogwu of Dignity Forum for People with Disability, got ADC membership card, while encouraging people with disability to join ADC where they would be allowed to aspire for political positions.
