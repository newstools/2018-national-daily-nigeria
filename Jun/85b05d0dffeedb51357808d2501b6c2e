The relations of  late Moshood Kashimawo Olawale Abiola, have requested the Federal Government to complement the recognition of June 12, 1993 injustice that sprang from the annulled presidential election believed to be won by Abiola of the SDP, to shift the inauguration date of newly elected president and governors from May 29 to June 12.
National Daily gathered that the relations  in Gbagura, Abeokuta, Ogun State capital, contended that the alteration of the coutnry’s transition timetable will complement the GCFR post-humous honoured award conferred on Abiola by President Muhammadu Buhari.
National Daily further gathered that the  Agura of Gbagura, Oba Halidu Laloko,  on behalf of the community, advocated  that the shift in the president’s tenure and handover date by two weeks, became necessary to properly acknowledge the June 12, 1993 annulment date and immortalise MKO Abiola, who sacrificed his life for the enthronement of democracy in Nigeria.
The Agura, represented  by the Balogun of Ojo-Gbagura, Adio Baiyewun,  lauded President Buhari for his recognition of June 12 Presidential election and for honouring Abiola with the highest national award in the country. He demanded  the National Assembly to pass a legislation to make  June 12 the new date for handing over in Nigeria. He argued that the decision will  ensure that  the supreme sacrifice made by late Abiola is properly immortalized.
“We see this as victory of truth over injustice, and as people of Gbagura and Ogun State at large, we are extremely glad that Mr. President has finally done what is just and fair with the posthumous award of GCFR on late Abiola and the declaration of June 12 as proper Democracy Day.
“We equally applaud the National Assembly led by the Senate for directing the Independent National Electoral Commission to formally declare Chief MKO Abiola winner and as an Ex-President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria with all his entitlements fully paid,” he declared.
