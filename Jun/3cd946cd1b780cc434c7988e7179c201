The Commissioner for Solid Minerals Development in Ebonyi State, Chief Francis Orji, has been handed indefinite suspension by the State Governor, David Umahi, for gross misconduct.
Sen. Emmanuel Onwe, Commissioner for Information and State Orientation, disclosed the suspension during a joint press briefing with other members of the State Executive Council (EXCO).
Onwe explained that Orji committed offensive acts embarrassing to the state government.
The Information Commissioner indicated that the Deputy Principal Secretary, Chief Emmanuel Obasi, will take charge as the acting commissioner for 30 days before the appointment of another substantive commissioner. Details of the misconduct were, however, not given.
Francis Orji was formerly Commissioner for Water Resources before he was reassigned to the Ministry of Border, Peace and Conflict Resolution and subsequently re-deployed to the Ministry of Solid Minerals.
