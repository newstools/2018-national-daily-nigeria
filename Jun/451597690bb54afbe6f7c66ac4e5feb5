Lord Sugar has come under fire from Twitter users over a tweet comparing the Senegalese national team to street sellers from a beach in Marbella.
While as ever there are a few people telling everyone to lighten up and not get offended by everything, this is clearly an extremely unfunny and ill thought out tweet from Sugar.
Senegal beat Poland yesterday in their first World Cup match since all the way back in 2002, putting in a fine display and causing something of an upset against Robert Lewandowski and co.
Sugar, however, has chosen to focus on something of a racist stereotype that has absolutely no place in the game.
Many have called him up on this tweet and we’ve provided a screen shot below for when he inevitably sees sense and deletes it.
This is hugely disappointing behaviour from a public figure, however, and the reaction below sums up pretty well how it’s gone down among fans…

This an absolutely disgraceful tweet.
It’s okay though, because he’s since tweeted about this amazing butterfly. Just out of admiration of the wonders of nature, though, not to divert attention away from anything else…
UPDATE: Lord Sugar has taken the tweet down, but couldn’t quite bring himself to apologise, saying he still thinks it’s funny…
Just been reading the reaction to my funny tweet about the guy on the beach in Marbella . Seems it has been interpreted in the wrong way as offensive by a few people . Frankly I cant see that I think it’s funny. But I will pull it down if you insist .
