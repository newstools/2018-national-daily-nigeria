Founder of Buruj Football Academy ,Salaudeen Waheed, has joined other well meaning Nigerians to hail President Muhammadu Buhari for his courageous decision to correct the wrong of the past by changing the country’s democracy day to June 12, a date that has been widely described as politically symbolic and historic for Nigeria’s democratic experiment,National Daily learnt.
Waheed told our reporter that what the President has done is something that will help the youths of this generation to imbibe the much needed spirit of sportsmanship and fairness in pursuit of their life goals saying even those who are not old enough to witness that watershed in Nigeria’s electoral evolution will be inspired by the course of history.
He also urged the Buhari administration to address the issue of endemic poverty and economic woes that has forced many youths to embrace hooliganism, killings and restiveness across the country, saying grassroots sports development is one area to be considered for such turn around citing the case of Chief MKO Abiola,  who established and funded Abiola Babes to create job for thousand of youths when he was alive.
He pledged his continued commitment to support the present administration at all levels by grooming and exporting the youths across the country to fulfill their potential in the round leather game.
