The Social Democratic Party (SDP) in Osun says Sen. Iyiola Omisore is not yet a member of the party in the state.
Chief Ademola Ishola, the party’s Chairman in Osun, who disclosed this at a news conference in Osogbo, also said Omisore’s governorship ambition was not known to the party.
Omisore had on May 20 announced his defection from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to SDP, the platform he said he would contest on in the Sept. 22 governorship election.
He had claimed that PDP in Osun was in disarray and likely to remain in prolonged political crisis.
But Ishola at the news conference said Omisore had yet to visit the party’s secretariat in the state neither had he purchased his expression of intention form.
“Since Omisore defected to SDP, we have not seen him in our party secretariat and neither has he picked his intention and nomination form.
“Rather than visiting us at the party secretariat in the state, Omisore was busy influencing people in Abuja,” Ishola said.
He said only three persons had shown interest to contest the governorship election on the platform of SDP.
Ishola named the three aspirants as Chief Kolawole Yemisi Adedeji, Mr Abdulwakeel Abdulwahab and Alhaji Kehinde Nurudeen.
Ishola added that only the three aspirants were recognised by the party, adding that Omisore’s governorship ambition was not known to SDP.
He, however, said the nomination form of the party could be obtained for N5 million.
Omisore, a former deputy governor of Osun, on Friday picked his nomination and expression of interest form at the SDP National Secretariat in Abuja.
He also vowed to win the Sept. 22 governorship election if emerges as the SDP candidate for the election.
