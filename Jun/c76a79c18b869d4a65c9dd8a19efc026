England defender Danny Rose told his family not to come to Russia for the World Cup over concerns they may be racially abused.
The Russian Football Association was fined Â£22,000 by FIFA, after racist chants were directed towards black French players during a friendly between the two nations in March, a seemingly lenient punishment Rose labelled “disgusting”.
“I am not worried about myself,” Rose told Standard Sport. “But I’ve told my family I don’t want them going out there because of the racism and anything else that may happen.”
Rose, who will be competing at his first World Cup, revealed his family were heartbroken, but believes it is in everybody’s best interests for them to stay away.
“My dad’s really upset. I could hear it in his voice. He said he may never get a chance again to come and watch me in a World Cup,” the Tottenham left-back said.
“I don’t want to sound like a cry baby. There are millions of people who have it much worse than I’ve had it. We’re big enough to deal with it and we’ve got the right people around us to help if anything was to occur.”
Quizzed on whether or not England had spoken about walking off the pitch, Rose said: “We’ve discussed it. Until it actually happens and under what circumstances, it’s hard to say what you’d actually do.”
