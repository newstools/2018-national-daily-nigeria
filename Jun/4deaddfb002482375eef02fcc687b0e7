President Muhammadu Buhari, singing the Not-Too-Young-To-Run Bill, into law at the State House, Abuja, on May 31, 2018, covertly scuttled the implementation of the law beginning with the 2019 general elections. The President, perhaps, because of his ambition for re-election for a second term in office, appealed to Nigerian youths to postpone their participation in the electoral process till after the 2019 elections.
Invariably, the president inversely endorsed the commencement of the law in 2023 when he might have completed his second term in office.
President Buhari had no doubt in the abilities of the Nigerian youths to participate actively in the electoral process but passionately asked them to postpone their campaigns till after 2019.  
 “I am confident each one of you will transform Nigeria in your own way – whether through media, agricultural enterprise, economists, engineers, or as lawmakers in your States or at Federal levels, or as State Governors – and even someday, as President. Why not?
“But please, can I ask you to postpone your campaigns till after the 2019 elections!
“Finally, let me say how proud I am, and how proud the entire country is, of what you have accomplished. Congratulations and best of luck with continuing to work to make Nigeria a greater country for us and future generations of Nigerians,” Buhari declared.
