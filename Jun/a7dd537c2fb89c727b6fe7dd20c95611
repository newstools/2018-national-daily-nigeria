lFormer Chelsea legend and current Derby County manager Frank Lampard has stated his belief that England can ‘go all the way’ at the World Cup,National Daily gathered.
Expectations of the Three Lions were dampened somewhat heading into the showpiece in Russia, with many keen to keep the pressure off what is a historically underachieving side at major tournaments.
A successful qualifying campaign was marred by what many perceived to be boring football, leading to speculation over whether Gareth Southgate’s charges would be able to make their mark on the competition.
And now, following England’s 6-1 thumping of Panama, those same fans have been joined by Lampard in starting to believe that football could indeed be coming home.
“I think the team have shown in their performances – and this is not me getting ahead of myself – just look at the talent in our squad and the way they’re playing, why should we write ourselves off?”
