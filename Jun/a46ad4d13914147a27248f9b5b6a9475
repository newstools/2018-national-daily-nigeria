Special Adviser to President Muhammadu Buhari on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina has blamed the opposition for the spate of killings in the northern part of the country.

Speaking on Arise TV on Wednesday, Adesina accused the opposition of sponsoring the widespread killings in the country in other to discredit the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari.

He said the opposition resorted to the ‘bestial act’ to discredit Buhari’s scorecard on security and also weaken the government.

Adesina said security agencies were investigating those behind the killings, adding that they will be dealt with once they are identified.

“You have the true herders and farmers who are clashing and you have hidden hostile hands who have crept in under that umbrella to play what the president has described as irresponsible politics,” he said.

“This farmers/herders’ clash has been going on for a long time. When I say long time, I mean far long before this administration.

“Like the president said, the issue is even older than anybody living today. What you have today are being sponsored because they know security is one of the strongest points of the administration.
 
“The president said so in a national broadcast. He also said the security agencies are investigating and has warned that once they are identified, they will be dealt with.

“The intention of the opposition in any democracy is to weaken the incumbent as much as possible and the opposition in Nigeria has identified security as one of the strong points of the Buhari administration. So they decided to go to that area finding the soft under belly and stick a knife into it.”
