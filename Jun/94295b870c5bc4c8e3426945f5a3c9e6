A sharia court sitting in Magajin Gari, Kaduna, on Thursday ordered one Abubakar Mustapha be remanded for allegedly enticing and wooing a married woman.
The complainant, Yusuf Sadi, told the court that when his wife Nusaiba went to her parent’s house at Kafanchan to be delivered of a baby, she refused to come back home because Mustapha had started making advances to her.
Sadi said that Mustapha had once called told him that Nusaiba was no longer his wife.
“When I travelled to Kafanchan to see my wife and our baby, Mustapha called my wife to his room and I followed her.
“Upon reaching his room, he shouted at me, saying he only called my wife not me, threatening to deal with me,” he said.
Sadi pleaded with the court to intervene in the matter and compel Mustapha to stop interfering in his marriage.
He also prayed to the court to assist him in bringing back his wife to their matrimonial home.
Mustapha, however, pleaded not guilty to the charges, which contravened Section 226 of the Kaduna State Sharia Penal Code 2002.
His plea was not taken by the court.
The judge, Mallam Musa Sa’ad, ruled that the accused be remanded in police custody pending his bail perfection.
