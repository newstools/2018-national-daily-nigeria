Manchester United manager, Jose Mourinho is prepared to launch a £60million bid, in order to be reunited with Chelsea midfielder, Willian.
National Daily reports that Mourinho remains an admirer of Willian’s style, having beat Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur to the Brazilian’s signature in 2013, when he was at Stamford Bridge.
Since the Portuguese’s departure to Old Trafford, Willian has struggled to hold down a regular place at Chelsea.
Last season, the 29-year-old started only 20 matches in the Premier League.
He also hid Antonio Conte in an Instagram photo celebrating the Blues’ FA Cup victory, leading to speculation that he is eager to move on this summer.
