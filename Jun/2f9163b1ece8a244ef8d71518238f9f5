Marco Reus said Germany had proven many of their own fans wrong by bouncing back from potential World Cup elimination to put their campaign on course with a thrilling 2-1 victory over Sweden ,National Daily learnt.
Die Mannschaft were heavily criticised in their own country after slipping to a 1-0 defeat against Mexico in their Group F opener, which made victory against Sweden vital if Joachim Low’s men were to remain in control of their own destiny.
They achieved that victory in dramatic style, recovering from Ola Toivonen’s first-half strike for Sweden and turning the game on its head through goals from Reus and Toni Kroos – the latter a 95th-minute free-kick that sent Germany’s fans and players into jubilant celebrations.
Borussia Dortmund midfielder Reus was asked whether he felt that some Germans were willing their team to lose in order to prompt a shake-up in the ranks, and he said: “I think it is indeed something that we have an impression of.
“Many people in Germany were looking forward to us bowing out of the tournament. But I think we have shown a team spirit, despite Sweden going ahead.
“Of course that was a setback and we had to digest that first, but we came back immediately and could have scored one or two more, but it was that final finish, that final determination was missing.”
