The data also showed that in April, Globacom lost 321,497 internet users decreasing its subscription to 26.372 million from the 26.693 million recorded in March.

This drop in internet subscribers, National Daily gathered may not be unconnected with the telecoms declining services in recent times.

Glo, which prides itself as the ‘Grand master of data’ has been having great difficulties maintaining its services because of the mammoth crowd that ported to its services due to the massive data it gives at affordable prices.
