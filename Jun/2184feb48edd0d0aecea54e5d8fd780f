Orji Uzor Kalu, former governor of Abia state, says it is looters that are opposed to the re-election bid of President Muhammadu Buhari.

He said the looters don’t want the government to save money for poor people, adding that they are bent on milking the treasury dry.

While paying a courtesy call to Abdullahi Ganduje, governor of Kano state, on Saturday, he said the president “is going for eight years”.

The former governor also applauded Buhari’s anti-corruption fight and economic recovery.
 
“Those who are opposed to the second term bid of PMB want to loot the treasury of Nigeria, and I bet you it will never happen again,” he said.
 
“They (looters) don’t want us to save money for poor people, and we can’t be celebrating sallah everyday. They have ‘chop’ enough, and they should allow the masses to chop the remaining one, and this is why we will continue to ask you don’t leave PMB.
 
“Buhari is our president; he is going for 8 years, and therefore called on stakeholders to support the second term project in the overall interest of the downtrodden.”
 
Kalu also presented two plaques to Ganduje for supporting the president’s 2019 agenda and for his effort on sustaining peaceful coexistence in Kano.
 
Ganduje assured him that the president has never lost an election in Kano and that it will be the same case in 2019.
