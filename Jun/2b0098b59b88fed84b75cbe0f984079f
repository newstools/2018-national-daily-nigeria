Juventus general manager Beppe Marotta insists the club cannot sign Inter striker Mauro Icardi this summer, insisting reports suggesting such are “fantasy football”,National Daily learnt.
Juve have been linked with a move for the mercurial Argentina international, with several outlets suggesting that Gonzalo Higuain could move the other way.
Marotta, though, says such talk is nonsense, and has scotched any suggesting that Inter have entered into negotiations with Icardi, who scored 29 goals in 34 Serie A appearances this season.
“Juventus players are considered unsellable, up until the moment they ask to be sold,” he told reporters. “In the case of Higuain, even if he’s at the World Cup, we’ve received no such request.“Icardi is a suggestion. Obviously we’re talking about an excellent player, one who belongs to Inter, and then there are these news reports that we’ve approached him.”
“All that falls into the realms of fantasy, fantasy football.”
