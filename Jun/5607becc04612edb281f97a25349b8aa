Super Eagles ,Head Coach Gernot Rohr has said the team’s formation against Croatia was the best to deploy as the team conceded from set pieces,National Daily learnt.
Recall that former Nigeria captain Austine Okocha has criticized the German for his tactical approach to the game which the West Africans lost 2-0.
Okocha had said the gaffer deployed the players in the wrong formation, causing the team to lose.
However, while speaking to reporters in Russia, the coach said, “We didn’t concede in normal play, we conceded only two goals from set pieces.
“This is not a question of tactics or system. Our system was okay, we cannot play with three (at the back) when there is only one centre forward.
“We played with four defenders because there were three Croatian strikers who are very strong. I was satisfied with the organisation of the team but what we missed in the game is being professional from set pieces.
“Each game is different. We know we can play with three centre backs but it was not a good day (Saturday) to do that.”
