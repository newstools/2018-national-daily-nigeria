Nigeria’s goalkeeper Francis Uzoho who is 19 years of age is celebrating his second son’s 17th birthday today, according to his Facebook post,National Daily learnt.
In a Facebook post that was immediately deleted, Francis showered words of praises on his son Michael. He posted:
“Wow my second son Michael is 17 today. I seek for God’s blessings for him. Daddy loves you boy”.
The goalkeeper, who might have forgotten that he is 19 years old and could not have a second son who is 17, immediately deleted the post.
Social Media users are still pouring in their birthday wishes and wishing Michael that his age doesn’t become static at 19 but grows beyond.
