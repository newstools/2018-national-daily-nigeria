The drama over the Police loggerhead with the Senate is yet to be laid to rest. The Offa robbery episode which the Police requested the President of the Senate, Dr. Abubakar Bukola Saraki, to respond to allegations of his linkage to the crime has set the polity agog over incessant attacks on the Senate President.
Meanwhile, National Daily gathered that the President of the Senate, Dr. Saraki, may have commenced consultations with his legal team to initiate a legal suit against the Cable News Network (CNN) over a report linking him to the April 5, 2018 bank robbery in Offa, Kwara State, which the Police said the suspects have been arrested and interrogated.
The CNN had reported that Saraki was linked to suspects involved in the bank robbery in which no fewer than 33 persons, including nine policemen, were killed.
The President of the Senate was said to have been provoked by the report which was made without crosschecking the facts, more so, when the investigations were yet to be concluded.
National Daily further gathered that Saraki is concluding arrangements to contact his lawyers in the United States of America to sue the CNN which is based in the US.
Meanwhile, some of the suspects arrested over the Offa robbery were gathered to have refuted linking the President of the Senate to the crime.
