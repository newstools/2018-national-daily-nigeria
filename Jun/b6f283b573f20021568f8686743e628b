Alton Towers has warned people not to fall for a fake ticket offer being circulated on Whatsapp.
The message claims the theme park is giving away five free passes to 500 families, to celebrate their 110th birthday.
It asks people to add their details to a survey then forward the message to 20 people to be in with a chance of winning.
As people pass it onto their contacts, it seems as though it has been endorsed by them. But Alton Towers warned people not to fall for it.
Replying to a tweet asking if it was real, they said: ‘Action is being taken to remove fake offer and we urge guests not to share their personal details or forward the offer to their contacts.
‘The safest way to buy tickets is always to go directly to our website.’
