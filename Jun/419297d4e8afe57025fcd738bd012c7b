The Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) has advised Nigerians to be wary of fake recruitment sites on social media especially on Watsapp and Facebook.
In a statement posted on its Facebook page at the weekend, Customs said the fraudsters with the new antics have succeeded in defrauding unsuspecting desperate job seekers.
NCS said it receives several complaints from victims of fraudsters who have been duped of various amounts running into millions of Naira.
“So, it is important to know that fraudsters are on prowl duping unsuspecting and desperate job seekers,” Customs said.
The service advised that no matter how genuine the advert may appear, members of the public should take a second look “even if the adverts look authentic and persuasive”.
It said the use of “the authentic Customs Website www.customs.gov.ng may sway many desperate job seekers”.
“No matter how smart criminals may be, they always leave something to give them away. Since their intention is to scam people, a point of payment is always incorporated in their adverts. This is not possible with the authentic website,” it added.
