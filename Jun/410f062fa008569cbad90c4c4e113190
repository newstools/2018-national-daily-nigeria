Former Governor Peter Obi of Anambra State has refuted media reports that he has been endorsed to have joint ticket with former Vice President Atiku Abubakar for the 2019 presidential election on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). The reports indicated that Obi has been selected as the running mate of Atiku Abubakar in the presidential race when the PDP national convention is yet to hold to elect the presidential candidate of the party.
Former Governor Obi, speaking through his Senior Special Assistant on Media, Valentine Obienyem, dismissed the reports as mere speculations. He was of the view that the PDP is more concerned at the moment on how to end the killings in the country by Fulani herdsmen before the 2019 general elections.

National Daily gathered that Obi’s SSA, Media had declared: “When I read the news in the papers and on social media, knowing fully that no presidential candidate has discussed such issue with him otherwise I should have known. When I saw the news, I exclaimed, ‘Who is the author of this mischief.
“I immediately brought the news to the attention of my boss who is rounding off his speaking engagements in U.K. and the USA and he was equally surprised that such speculation should be on at this time, when the per-occupation of all Nigerians should be how to end the killings in parts of the country and return the country back to sanity.”
The governor remarked that the PDP is presently preoccupied with re-branding and search for credible and strong candidate to stand the challenge of ousting the ruling party in 2019.
