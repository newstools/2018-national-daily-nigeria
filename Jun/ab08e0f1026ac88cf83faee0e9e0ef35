The German was given all sorts of problems by the world number 29 from Bosnia-Herzegovina before winning 6-2 3-6 4-6 7-6 (7-3) 7-5.
It is a second five-set win in a row for the 21-year-old.
But the fourth seed Grigor Dimitrov is out after losing to veteran Spaniard Fernando Verdasco in straight sets.
The Bulgarian was beaten 7-6 (7-4) 6-2 6-4 by the 34-year-old 30th seed, who will face Novak Djokovic in the last 16.
“You have to draw the line and look for the next chapter,” said Dimitrov, who has failed to make the second week at Roland Garros in eight attempts.
“In tennis, you never know, one week can always turn things around for you. It’s been proven to work in the past.”
