The 4-man team which departed from the Murtala Mohammed International Airport aboard a Qatar Airways flight was led by the Director of 3×3 Nigeria, Frank Jituboh.
The players are Azuoma Dike, David Godwin and Lucky Subel all from Kano Pillars Basketball Club and captain, Yahaya Abdul.
The captain expressed optimism that Nigeria, the current African Champions can make an impression despite making their world cup debut.

“Kida was the first person who saw the 3×3 vision and decided to invest in it through his AMK foundation when he was not even the President. I am not surprised that as the president of NBBF,  he has continued to support the latest basketball format which has continued to grow.”
