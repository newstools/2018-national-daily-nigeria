UEFA has handed Manchester City coach Pep Guardiola a one-match Champions League suspension following his sending off in the quarter-final second-leg loss to Liverpool in April.
Guardiola was dismissed from the touchline after remonstrating with official Antonio Mateu Lahoz over Leroy Sane’s disallowed goal in the first half of the Etihad Stadium encounter.
His suspension includes a second match which has been deferred during a season-long probationary period.
Liverpool, meanwhile, have been fined a combined €29,000 for supporter indiscretions in the quarter-finals and semi-finals, including “acts of damage” and setting off fireworks.
That damage includes that on the Manchester City bus, which needed to be replaced after it was hit with a series of missiles as it arrived at Anfield for the first leg of the Champions League quarter-final.
