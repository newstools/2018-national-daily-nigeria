Sunshine Stars Head Coach ,Henry Abiodun  is canvassing for ‘continuity’ of the Nigerian technical crew so as to enable the Eagles continue with their learning process.
Henry who spoke to National Daily recently said despite Nigeria’s group stage exit from the ongoing 2018 Fifa World Cup, the Nigeria Football Federation should allow Gernot Rohr continue as the national team coach.
A win over Iceland was sandwiched by losses to Croatia and Argentina which eventually fluffed the Super Eagles’ chances of progressing through to the Round of 16 at the quadrennial showpiece, thus, leaving question marks over the future of Rohr.
But the Sunshine Stars gaffer told National Daily that NFF should give  the German tactician to correct his lapses and lead the team to the next level,he must have learned one thing or the other from what transpired thus far. He must have had a good understanding of Nigerian football better than when he came.
Coach Abiodun added that “They should let him go for the Nations Cup again and let him build on what he has. We are talking about the youthfulness of our team and if truly they are, we should let him develop them. If there are some he feels are through with the team let them go. He should be made to look inward into the Nigerian league to fish out talents.
“There is no time to start talking about employing a new coach because a new coach will still face all these problems and will have to start all-over. Let us have a coach that will take us to the World Cup twice. It will be great for Nigeria.”
He concluded that “We lost that balance and the concentration was lost towards the dying moments of the game. We tried. We were not disgraced. We had controversial issues. We are Nigerians we cannot complain that we were cheated because we had our chances too that we didn’t take.
