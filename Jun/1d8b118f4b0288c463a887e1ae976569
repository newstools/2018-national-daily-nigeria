Wheat Farmers Association of Nigeria (WFAN) in Kano said it had dragged 2,000 farmers to court for defaulting to repay N270 million loan.
WFAN Chairman Faruk Rabi’u told journalists in Kano that 26 of the affected farmers had so far been arraigned before the Magistrates’ Court, Gyadi-gyadi, Kano.
Rabi’u, who is also the state chairman of the All Farmers Association of Nigeria (AFAN), said the court had also ordered the arrest of the remaining 1,974 farmers, who refused to acknowledge its summon.
He said the association secured the facility from the state government and some Agro dealers under the 2015/2016 and 2016/2017 wheat farming season.
“We sourced the loan from the state government and some stakeholders and disbursed to about 2, 000 wheat farmers in the state,” he said.
He said the association had no option than to take legal action against the defaulting farmers to serve as a deterrent to others who might contemplate committing same mistake.
He said the decision to secure the facility was aimed at assisting farmers and encourage them to stay in the business to boost wheat production.
“But regrettably, our members decided not to repay the loans after harvesting period,’ ‘Rabi’u said.
He said the association would ensure that those who benefited from the facility and defaulted in repayment were apprehended and prosecuted.
Rabi’u said the leadership of the association would soon commence public enlightenment on the need for farmers to ensure prompt payment of loans collected.
“Unless this is done, the government may stop giving farmers loan in the state,” Rabi’u stressed.
