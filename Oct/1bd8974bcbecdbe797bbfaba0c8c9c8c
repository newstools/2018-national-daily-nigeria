Radamel Falcao has emerged as a transfer target for David Beckham’s new MLS franchise Inter Miami.
The striker has been prolific throughout his career at Porto, Atletico Madrid and his current club Monaco.
However, his exploits on these shores with Manchester United and Chelsea yielded only five goals in 41 combines appearances.
His pedigree on the continent, however, is undoubted and when Beckham’s new team joins the MLS in 2020, the Colombian could provide the forward line with some much-needed fire power.
And, according to Sport, Inter Miami are growing increasingly interested in acquiring his services.
The 32-year-old has netted three times in nine outings in all competitions this term, which pales in comparison to his prolificacy in front of goal in previous season.
His form with Monaco in recent years, which helped them win Ligue 1 in 2016-17, has attracted further interest from MLS, with Sport claiming Columbus Crew are also keen on taking him Stateside.
Just recently, Beckham was reported to have spoken with former Real Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane about potentially managing the club, while Cristiano Ronaldo is at the top of his list of potential transfer targets.
