A day after footballer Obafemi Martins gifted ex, BBNaija housemate, Khloe with a car, there were theories circulating as to his reason for such gesture, considering he is married.
Well, his wife, Abigail who is a footballer, Mario Ballotelli’s sister, has rubbished the rumors of an affair, or a ‘th-e-so-e’ situation, revealing she was aware of the car gift and even calling Khloe a ‘nice girl who deserves it’.
And now it appears they are best of friends as when Khloe made reference to love free things. Abigail dropped a comment, calling her silly.
On the flipside, they could pass for sisters and if we didn’t know better, we would be tempted to believe the theory about them being ‘sister wives’.
