Following the ceaseless crisis rocking the ruling APC since it concluded its primary elections, more of its honourables in the House of Reps are ready to cross over to the opposition.
No fewer than 36 are set to defect next week.
And the would-be defectors are among the 70 disgruntled because thry lost their return tickets.
Although they took their losses to the appeal panel the party set up. not many of them were lucky.
Only eight had their cases resolved.
Kaduna Rep Musa Soba, one those affected, got really angry at what he called injustice that he resigned right there on the floor last Wednesday.
According to him, others will soon defect in droves latest by November 17.
The APC leadership in the House, however, promise all the cases, genuine or not, will be resolved, and that many of the reps affected are APC die hards that wonâ€™t defect no matter what.
But that may not be entirely so.
Effort by President Muhammadu Buhari to pacify these terrible losers has not yielded any result as the aggrieved members keep leaving. Those still hanging around are threatening to leave.
Buhari last week called the federal lawmakers to Aso Rock to have a word with them about the crisis.
More of such meeting have been going on since the conclusion of the primary.
