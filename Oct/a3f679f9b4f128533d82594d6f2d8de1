The Peoples Democratic Party has forwarded Senate President Bukola Saraki’s name to the Independent National Electoral Commission as the party’s senatorial candidate.
His name was among the list of candidates submitted to the commission in Abuja on Thursday night—weeks after he lost the presidential ticket, and missed the senatorial primaries.
The Kwara Central senator now replaces a candidate not yet identified on the list.
The PDP national leadership made this substitution based on a grnd scheme that Saraki will get back in the topmost seat in the Senate if its flagbearer Atiku Abubakar wins the 2019 presidential election.
Atlkuand Saraki contested the PDP presidential primary, with the senator coming a distant third behind the former vice president.
Both politicians defected from the ruling APC in the build-up to the primary election.
