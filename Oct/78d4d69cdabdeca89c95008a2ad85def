to suceed Usain bolt

Kylian Mbappé has signed a contract with the Hublot luxury watch brand. The world champion succeeds Usain Bolt.
Kylian Mbappé will be showing around the world. The world champion has signed a contract to become the new face of the luxury watch brand Hublot and succeeded Usain Bolt in this role, says Le Figaro.
“We partner with Kylian because, with his excellence in the field and his humility outside, it appeals to young people as well as middle-aged people,” says Philippe Tardivel, marketing director of the Swiss brand.
One million euros a year?
Except for Nike, its equipment supplier, Hublot will be the first sponsor of Mbappé, the amount of the contract has not been communicated but could be of the order of one million euros per year.
“Kylian was already wearing Hublot before this partnership,” said her lawyer, Delphine Verheyden, “and this brand is legitimate in football because it sponsors FIFA and UEFA.” On November 8, the watchmaker will organize a meeting in Paris between Mbappé and Pelé, also under contract with the brand.
