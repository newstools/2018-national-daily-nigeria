Kylian Mbappe further underlined his status as the best young player in the world after making history by scoring four times as Paris Saint-Germain rompted to victory over Lyon.
Mbappe scooped the best young player award as France won the World Cup in the summer and is expected to become the first individual to retain the Golden Boy prize.
The former Monaco forward had enjoyed an impressive start to the 2018-19 campaign, scoring four times in as many Ligue 1 games but was forced to miss three matches after being sent off against Nimes Olympique in September.
Mbappeâ€™s haul saw him become the youngster player in 45 seasons to score four goals in one French top flight match in a victory which all-but secures a second straight title for PSG.
