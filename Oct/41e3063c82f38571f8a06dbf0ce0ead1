Mighty Jets on Sunday at the Zaria road stadium, Jos brought to an end Kada City eight straight wins at the ongoing 2017/18  Bet9ja NNL campaign in a thriller of an encounter.
There were just three minutes on the clock of the matchday 13 fixture when Zaidu Ayuba converted from the penalty spot for the home side after Ahmed Abubakar late tackle caught Inah Isah as the center referee rightly pointed to the penalty spot.
The home team had another opportunity to double their lead  fifteen minutes later when Okiki Musampa intercepted a defensive mix-up but pulled the trigger too quickly.
This time, it was twenty-one minutes of action played when Emmanuel Okoh in goal for Kada City made a spectacular save, Inah Isah lashed on the rebound but Kabiru Sarki Adewale made a touch clearance denying the jersey number 11 from scoring.
Kada City took the game to the home side after the few scary moments by bossing possession which earned Kada City three quick corner kicks and in one of those corner kicks, James Joseph Igboyi was presented with a free header but missed target by the whiskers on the 43rd minute.
At the resumption of the break, Kada City continued their dominance with Onovo David and Kabiru Sanusi causing some problems for the defense line of the home side with their pace and intelligent dribbles.
Coach Shola Ibrahim Adewuyi introduced Innocent Ogra and Abdulakeem Adeyemo to strengthen the attack and it almost paid off when Kabiru Sanusi well taken free kick in the 65th minute narrowly missed target with the goalkeeper completely beaten.
Igoche Anthony who replaced Okiki Musampa in the second half puts the match beyond the reach of the visitors when he calmly slot home from close range in the 84th minute to make the scoreline 2-0 in favour of the home side bringing to an end Kada City unbeaten run of eight straight wins since 12th of May after suffering a 0-1 defeat to NAF FC of Abuja at the Area 3 field.
