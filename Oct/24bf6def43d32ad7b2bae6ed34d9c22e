Maurizio Sarri has revealed the touchline conversation he had with Jurgen Klopp that saw the Chelsea boss quiz the German over why he was smiling despite being behind.
Liverpool were trailing the Blues 1-0 in September’s Premier League clash at Stamford Bridge after Eden Hazard smashed home past Alisson Becker in the first half.
The Reds did manage to grab a point from the game, however, as Daniel Sturridge’s late strike from distance got the better of Kepa Arrizabalaga to ensure it would finish 1-1.
He told Corriere dello Sport: “There are times when a great show convinces you to put aside any regrets. Even if you suffer a goal in the last minute or the fifth minute of injury time. And that [the game at Stamford Bridge against Liverpool] had been an extraordinary show.
“Ten minutes before… Klopp looks at me and I don’t understand. The match is still in progress, I ask him: ‘Why are you smiling?’. And he says: ‘Are not you having fun?’
“I in return I say: ‘Very much’. And he says: ‘Me too!’ And he’s losing. Then the Sturridge goal comes, but remembering that moment we hugged like two old friends.
“Here [in English football] it’s nice for this, I’m sure he would have done it even if Liverpool had not equalised. Premier League is the full taste of football, everything is different.”
