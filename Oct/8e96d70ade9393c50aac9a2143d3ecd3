Forgotten Super Eagles star Victor Anichebe has reported his own club, Beijing Enterprises, to FIFA over allegations of match-fixing.
The 30-year-old forward quits Sunderland for a move to the China League One side last summer, but Everton man has been in dispute with the Chinese second-tier club since last October and made the accusation after he was asked “not to try” by coaches on two separate occasions.
According to Daily Mail claiming that the lawyer for Anichebe, Chris Farnell, confirmed: “We have been instructed to approach Beijing’s general manager on the player’s behalf but, to date, his appeals for action have been ignored on two occasions.
“We have since reported the matter to the appropriate associations.”
It is not the first allegation of match-fixing in Chinese football.
Anichebe won a silver medal in 2008 Beijing Olympic Games made 11 appearances, scoring twice for the Beijing Enterprises before he quit the Chinese second division club in January.
