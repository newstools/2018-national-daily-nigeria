Manchester United have been named as the top club in Europe’s top five leagues in terms of sponsorship revenue.

The report by media company CSM Sport & Entertainment analysed sponsorship deals spanning across the top five European football leagues – in England, Spain, Italy, Germany and France.

Manchester United topped the club-by-club list, generating €269 million (£235m/$309m) per year from 68 commercial deals. Spanish champions Barcelona were close behind, with a yearly income of €261m (£229m/$299m) – the only other club to generate more than €200m.

European heavyweights Bayern Munich and Real Madrid lead a quartet of English clubs (Chelsea, Manchester City, Arsenal and Liverpool) in revenue, while the top 10 was rounded off by the current champions of France and Italy – Paris Saint-Germain and Juventus.

Eleventh-placed Borussia Dortmund completed CSM’s top sponsorship list, despite having more sponsor deals than any of the top 10 clubs with 71 – generating just €80m (£70m/$92m) per-year.
