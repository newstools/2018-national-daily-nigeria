The Belgian is delighted to be back in action after being sidelined for weeks with an injury and is targeting Champions League victory.
Manchester City star Kevin De Bruyne says he feels good since his return from injury as he gets “back into the rhythm” of playing for the Premier League champions.
The Belgian attacker was ruled out for two months after suffering an injury in the first game of the season, making his return in the last 30 minutes of Saturday’s 5-0 win over Burnley.
He was back making an influence in the Champions League on Tuesday by assisting Aymeric Laporte for his side’s second in the 3-0 win at Shakhtar Donetsk.
And De Bruyne says he is happy to be back and in good shape after his spell on the sidelines.
“I feel good. I’m back, I’m playing, I think I did well,” he told reporters. “I’m getting stronger and stronger, I just need games to get back into the rhythm but to play half an hour (at the weekend) and 70 minutes today is fine.
“I think they did really well [while I was injured]. They didn’t lose, apart from the Lyon game, so I think the team did really well without me, but I didn’t expect anything different.”
Although De Bruyne is unsure if City can go all the way to win the Champions League this year, he takes confidence from them being first in the group after three games.
