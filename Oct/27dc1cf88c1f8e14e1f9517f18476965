Willian admits the rest of the Chelsea players need to do more to ease the burden on Eden Hazard.
The Belgium international sustained a back injury during the 2-2 draw against Manchester United on Saturday after being singled out for special treatment by the visitors.
Not only was he marked very closely by Ashley Young, Manchester United players took it in turns to foul the 27-year-old.
Hazard, who is the club’s top scorer on eight goals, is now expected to miss the Europa League game against Bate Borisov on Thursday, while he is also a doubt for the League fixture at Burnley on Sunday.
Willian revealed: “We know how important Hazard is for us, but we have a great team with a lot of quality players.
“Sometimes he can’t score or make an assist, that’s why we need the whole team. Sometimes he tries and it doesn’t work.
“The other players have to work together to try and do something with each other. Against Manchester United was like that. He tried to score, he tried to dribble.
“They put two-three players around him every time he had the ball and maybe that was why it was difficult for him.
“Will teams look to target him? Yes of course – when a game is like that they look at him, but it means others can find more space.”
