The Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP) has declared that Lagos residents were prepared to re-elect embattled Governor Akinwunmi Ambode if he simply dump the All Progressives Congress for the PDP.
In a statement personally signed by Chinedu Eya, a PDP chieftain, who earlier promised to sell his Lagos house to help the governor purchase a PDP ticket, he charged Ambode to disregard the recent endorsement of his opponent, Sanwo Olu by 36 lawmakers of state’s House of Assembly as well as the pressure on him to stand down from 2019 elections.
He described the move against Ambode as a ‘mockery of God’s supremacy’.
“Like I said last week, I am willing to sell off my building in Lagos here to purchase nomination and expression of interest forms for Governor Ambode, even if he chooses to contest under any other platform other than the PDP, in the case of his orchestrated loss in the APC’s primary, following the pervading gang up against him.
“The Lawmakers and their pay masters are playing God. But they will receive the shock of their lives as over 20 million Lagosians are willing to support Governor Ambode, even if he flies any other party’s flag in the contest.
“I want the governor to disregard the recent endorsement of Mr. Sanwo Olu by over 36 lawmakers in the state, as that can never take the place of over 20 million Lagosians who are ready to return their working governor come 2019, under any other platform,” he said.
Eya likened the battle between Governor Ambode and Ahmed Tinubu to the biblical tussle between David and Goliath and asked the former to be inspired.
The governor is currently deserted as critical stakeholders in the state have pitch tents with his rival, Babajide Sanwo-Olu.
A former banker, he is believed to have the backing of Mandate Movement, a group loyal to Bola Tinubu, chieftain of the APC.
