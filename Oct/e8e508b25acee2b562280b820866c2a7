The Ogun Federal Road Safety Corps, on Monday, advised applicants to go to appropriate centres  to obtain the driver’s licence.
Mr Clement Oladele, the Ogun Sector Commander of FRSC, gave the advice in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria on Monday in Ota, Ogun.
Oladele urged the public to desist from allowing their spouses or someone else to process the driver’s licence on their behalf.
He said that this practice had contributed to delay in collecting most driver’s licences.
Oladele noted that some applicants did not give correct information like their phone numbers.
“We sent bulk SMS to applicants when their licences are ready but in a situation where they give wrong phone numbers, the text messages will not get to them,” he said.
Oladele advised applicants to always contact the nearest centre for any change of information in order not to delay the collection of licence.
