John Terry has taken his first steps in management after helping Chelsea’s U19s smash Molde 10-1.
Chelsea legend Terry is focusing on becoming a boss after leaving Aston Villa in the summer when his playing contract expired.
He is assisting Chelsea U23 coach Joe Edwards at the moment with the coaching of the club’s U19s.
Ex-Blues centre-back and captain Terry got off to a memorable start with a huge win at Cobham on Wednesday afternoon in the UEFA Youth League.
Terry is helping run the side on a non-contract basis to keep his options open.
But he has made no secret of his eventual ambitions of bossing Chelsea’s first team one day.
He is understood to have helped Edwards coach and select the side and also given a team talk.
Billy Gimour and Daishawn Redan both got hat-tricks while Charlie Brown bagged a brace as George McEachran and an own goal from Thor Olav Moe saw the Blues hit double figures.
Chelsea, playing 3-5-2, conceded a consolation goal to Anders Iversen with just under 20 minutes to go.
But it is the team’s biggest ever win in Europe and equals the record win in the competition set when Real Madrid beat Apoel 10-1 last year.
