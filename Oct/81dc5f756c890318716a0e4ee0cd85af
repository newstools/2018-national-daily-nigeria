The self-acclaimed leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) Nnamdi Kanu, at the weekend addressed President Muhammadu Buhari as ‘late Buhari’ in his second broadcast to “Biafrans” since his resurgence.
Recall that Kanu, and top leaders of his group fled Nigeria last September following declaration by the Nigerian Army that IPOB and other Pro-Biafran groups were terrorists’ organisations.
Kanu and his top lieutenants had ‘disappeared’ from his country home in Afaraukwu near Umuahia and other places he frequently visited only for him to resurface in Israel last week.
In his first address to ‘Biafrans’ on October 19, he boasted: “I promised the Zoo that I will be coming to Biafra and I came. I do not recognise the court of the Zoo. I want the people of the Middle Belt to rise and join IPO.”
Addressing “Biafrans” again for the second time on Saturday in a live broadcast via radio Biafra, Kanu spoke on President Muhammadu Buhari’s certificate saga, Sambo Dasuki’s continuous detention, 2019 elections, restructuring and many more.
In the broadcast, the IPOB leader alleged that President Buhari is dead and that a certain Jubril from Sudan is the one acting as Nigeria’s President.
The pro-Biafra activist alleged that President Buhari died in Saudi Arabia on January 27, 2017.
“Buhari died in Saudi Arabia, they went to bring that thing from Sudan to rule the zoo. I will unmask Jubril next month,” the IPOB leader said.
“Buhari died 27 of January 2017, that thing in Aso Rock does it look like Buhari? Can’t you see his fingers? The pro-Biafra activist asked.
