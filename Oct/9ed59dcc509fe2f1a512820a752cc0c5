The National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), has suspended till further notice, orientation course for the 2018 Batch C Stream I, scheduled to commence on Tuesday, following unfavorable security reports.
A statement by Mrs Adenike Adeyemi, the NYSC Director of Press, issued on Monday in Abuja, advised prospective corps members posted to the Kaduna state to remain at home until further notice.
Adeyemi said that current security situation in the state and the consequent curfew imposed by the state government forced the scheme to suspend orientation in the state.
She however, advised other prospective corps members deployed to other states and the FCT, to report at their various orientation camps on Tuesday Oct. 23, as scheduled.
