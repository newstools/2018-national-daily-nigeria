Super Eagles’ Technical Adviser Gernot Rohr has lost his wallet containing his Samsung 8 Android telephone and his credit cards/work permit that enables him to visit Nigeria legally anytime there is need to be with the Super Eagles or meet officially with his employers- the Nigeria Football Federation.
“I lost my wallet containing my Samsung 8 and my visa visiting card just after the Aiteo Cup final in Asaba on Wednesday.
“I was trying to exit the stadium but the fans were many pushing and running up and down. So I didn’t know the time my wallet was stolen. I am appealing to whoever took it to please return it to me because I am also a Nigerian by working with our darling Super Eagles.
‘The documents are very vital for my work with the Eagles and the Nigeria Football Federation. We still have many qualifying and other friendly matches to play and I won’t be able to do the work without the items. I will personally reward whoever help find the wallet with the items in it”.
