Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has drawn the ire of the PDP with his sarcastic joke about learnung Shaku-shaku dance steps to boost the APC chances in 2019 election.
At a book launch in Abuja weekend, referred to the PDP guber candidate in Oshun who danced his way into the election and got 250,000 votes.
“So myself and Kabir are now learning Shaku Shaku; we have to learn; who knows what will win,” he said.
But the PDP vice-presidential candidate and the Bayelsa Sen. Ben Murray Bruce have reacted angrily, saying it was inappropriate for a government under which people are suffering to prioritise dancing Shaku-shaku, a damce popularise by hip-hop star Olumide.
“I know Vice President Osibanjo is a gentleman and may not have made such a comment, said Peter Obi on his returm from a strategic meeting with flagbearer Atiku Abubakar in Dubai.
“However, why I am not against people dancing or learning how to dance “Shaku Shaku”, for me in particular, this period calls for sober reflection not dancing or learning how to dance as there are many challenges facing our nation at the moment.”
Bruce reaction was tweeted Monday, stating “under your watch, 11 million jobs created by other administrations have been lost, Naira has lost 80% of her value and Nigeria has been named the world headquarters for extreme poverty, yet @ProfOsinbajo’s priority is learning ‘shaku shaku’ dance? I would laugh if I wasn’t so sad.”
