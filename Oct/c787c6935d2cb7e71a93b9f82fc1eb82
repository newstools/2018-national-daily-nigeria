Barcelona and Real Madrid were wished the best of luck in luring Neymar from PSG by the striker’s team-mate Marquinhos.
Reports emerged in the Spanish press on Wednesday that both El Classico clubs were interested in signing the Brazilian, but Neymar dismissed them on social media as “fake news”.
Barca head coach Ernesto Valverde refused to rule out the possibiltiy of him rejoining though, amid claims that a €222 million (£193m/$256m) fee would be required to secure the forward’s signature.
“I wish Real Madrid and Barcelona the best of luck in their attempt to bring Neymar away from here,” the defender sarcastically told reporters after his side’s 5-0 win over Amiens.
“People know what our president is like, how he is with his people and how he loves our important players.
“So I don’t see any reason why he should leave. He has even denied it on social media so I can’t speak for him, you should ask him.”
