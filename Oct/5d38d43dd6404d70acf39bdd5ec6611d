The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has warned against illegal operation by automated vehicular tracking (AVT) operators, saying it would invoke sanctions against anyone operating without licenses.
Emilia Nwokoro, Enugu Zonal Controller of the Commission, disclosed that it was illegal for people to operate vehicular tracking services without registering with the commission, stressing that registration would help regulate their services.
Speaking during the unsealing of the D-Tech Multi Services, she stated that the commission’s enforcement procedures empowered it to seal off AVT services operating without license, explaining that D-Tech Multi Services was sealed off on October 31, last, following the refusal of its managers to regularize their operations with the commission.
She explained that the aim of registering the operators was to enhance security of services and ensure that vehicle owners deal with genuine auto- trackers in the state and called on members of the public to furnish her office with information concerning illegal operators in the state.
