Ghana Football Normalisation Committee and the sixteen Premier League clubs have agreed that they will not participate in the CAF inter-club competitions for 2019.

The 2018 league season came to an unexpected halt following an expose by journalist Anas Anas detailing how corruption had thrived in the countryâ€™s football fraternity.

Before the league halted, Medeama Stars was leading the pack thus in contention for a berth in the CAF Champions League and Kumasi Asante Kotoko and Ashanti Gold were chasing a slot in the second tier competition; the CAF Confederations Cup.

The Normalisation Committee held the meeting with the clubs at the Alisa Hotel in Accra on Friday.

Ghana now joins another twelve countries that failed to meet the deadline to submit their respective clubs for CAF competitions. The other nations are Comoros, Eritrea, Guinea Bissau, Mauritius, Sao Tome and Principe as well as Sierra Leone and Somalia Tunisia, Mozambique, Namibia, Benin and Botswana.
