Life after Cristiano Ronaldo and Zinedine Zidane has been really, really tough for Real Madrid.
Los Blancos sacked Julen Lopetegui on Monday, one day after a humiliating 5-1 defeat to Barcelona in the league.
The result leaves Real in ninth place the table and without a league win in five matches.
Lopetegui’s departure was inevitable. Castilla boss Santiago Solari has been appointed interim coach while the search for a permanent replacement continues.
There were reports that former Chelsea boss Antonio Conte would take over but the Italian has ruled himself out of the job, National daily gathered.
Conte doesn’t feel that the project is right for him.
That project was tempting after Real won a third-straight Champions League title in Liverpool but it’s not quite so appealing now.
SERGIO RAMOS TWEETED 
The players haven’t stepped up and we’re seeing just how important Ronaldo was to the club.
But captain Sergio Ramos believes the players have to shoulder the responsibility for Real’s form – and has called upon them to turn it around.
Ramos tweeted on Wednesday morning: “We are aware and feel responsible for this situation.
“We’re aware and feel responsible for this situation. But this is no time to talk, it’s time to act. Today’s the first step #HalaMadrid”.
