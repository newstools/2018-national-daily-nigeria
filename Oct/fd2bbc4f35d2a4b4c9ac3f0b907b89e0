Jose Mourinho says there are “many different reasons” why Manchester United are struggling this season and admits it would be unacceptable to go five matches without a win.
The United boss held a three-minute press conference on Friday morning where he only answered questions about Saturday’s game against Newcastle.
When asked why United are struggling this season, Mourinho replied: “For many different reasons.”
United have gone five games without a win just once since 1999, and when it was put to Mourinho that such a sequence for a club of United’s size is not acceptable, he said: “Yes, I accept [it is not good enough].”
