The EFCC has filed corruption charges against Ekiti’s ex-Gov. Ayodele Fayose, and his hotel, Spotless Investment Limited.
No date fixed for hearing yet.
In the charges before the Federal High Court in Abuja, Fayose is accused of receiving about N1.3bn when he “ought to have known that the said fund formed part of the proceeds of an unlawful activity of Col. Sambo Dasuki (retd.), the then National Security Adviser, and thereby committed an offence contrary to Section 18(a) of the Money Laundering (Prohibition) Act, 2011 (as amended in 2012) and punishable under Section 15 (3) of the same Act.”
He was also accused of sending his aide, Abiodun Agbele, to receive about N1.3bn from a former Minister of State for Defence, Musiliu Obanikoro, sometime in June 2014.
The commission said the N1.3bn was flown to Akure Airport and Obanikoro handed over the money to Agbele, who is also standing trial for corruption.
According to the commission, officials of Zenith Bank arrived at the Akure Airport tarmac, and conveyed the cash in a bullion van to the bank’s vault located at 13, Alagbaka Estate, Akure.
Bank tellers Agbele allegedly gave as bank instructions at different times to pay in money into Fayose’s Zenith Bank account were tendered as evidence.
On how the money was spent, the commission said Agbele directed the bank to pay N137m into the account of Ayodele Fayose with number 1003126654 and Bank Verification Number 22338867502. The bank teller dated June 26, 2014, was filled by Agbele with teller number 0556814.
Agbele also allegedly directed the bank to transfer N118,760,000 to the same account and paid in N50m cash into Fayose’s account.
On April 7, 2015, Fayose personally moved N300m to his fixed deposit account at Zenith Bank in Ketu, Lagos, with number 9013074033 with his same BVN.
On the instruction of Fayose, Agbele deposited N100m to the account of Spotless Investment Limited owned by Fayose and his wife, Olayemi.
Fayose allegedly bought houses in Abuja and Lagos.
The houses have been seized, and his bank accounts with a balance of N380m have been frozen.
