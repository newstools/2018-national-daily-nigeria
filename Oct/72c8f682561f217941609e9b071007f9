The head coach of U 20 coach Paul Aigbogun has denied the story going round that he has been link with the job of the promise keeper.
He went further to express the readiness of flying Eagles to resume camping in earnest .
We have sent out our proposal to the technical committee of the Federation and i think they  are doing everything within their power  to ensure we go back to camp as soon as possible.
Concerning  being linked to the job of technical adviser of Akwa United , i want categorically deny the allegations i have never spoken to anybody about such i was even surprised to wake up to see the head lines about it.
When asked if he would love to take the offer,  he said no for now because i am already engaged with coaching  the U 20  and i want to concentrate on the team  to achieve a desired result.
