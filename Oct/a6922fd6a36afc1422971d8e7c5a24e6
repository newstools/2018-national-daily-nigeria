The Mushin Empowerment Foundation has thrown it’s weight behind Mr. Babajide Sanwoolu prior to the All Progressive Congress gubernatorial primaries, citing Governor Akinwunmi Ambode’s poor attitude to governance which revert Lagos back to a filthy state.

Speaking at the APC party Secretariat in Mushin, during MEF’s general meeting, the former party chairman Aremo Ikufisile Michael, who address the mammoth crowd of party faithful, said that Babajide Sanwoolu has been endorsed by the leaders and stakeholders in the party as their gubernatorial candidate and they cannot but replicate it in MEF given the fact that Dr. Muiz Banire, who initiated the foundation had endorsed him,likewise Baba Hamzat.

” MEF in APC is headed by Muiz Banire, we are all children baba Hamzat.
Lagos has faired badly under Ambode’s watch,see all the street of Lagos now littered with waste  indiscriminately dispose all because he stopped PSP’s operation and replaced with an incompetent handler vision scape.

All the job opportunities that normally come to us at the party was stopped, we endorse Sanwoolu today and will work assiduously to ensure his victory at the Monday primary.

Another stakeholder in Mushin polity, Alhaja Olushola Oyelede alias (Iya Luku) also corroborated Ikufisile,stating in clear terms that the former Commissioner for Work Mr. Kunle Hamzat is penciled down for the Deputy Governor being their son, citing the development as a welcome idea for Mushin people.

It would recalled that Hamzat stepped down for Sanwoolu earlier on Friday, citing his competence for the task at stake, being part of the Lagos project.
