Former President Barack Obama and former Secretary of States Hillary Clinton were sent packages identified as Potential Explosive Devices in the mail.
The packages, the National Daily gathered, were however intercepted by the U.S. Secret Service, and the agency has opened a criminal investigation into the incidents.
“The packages were immediately identified during routine mail screening procedures as potential explosive devices and were appropriately handled as such,” the Secret Service said in an emailed statement Wednesday.
But the two recipients did not receive the package.
Nick Merrill, a spokesman for Hillary Clinton, said in a tweet that “nothing got to any home.”
Police on Monday defused a pipe-bomb found at a residence in New York’s suburbs owned by billionaire philanthropist and Democratic donor George Soros.
In the developing story, there were reports of other potentially dangerous packages also sent to CNN.
CNN said it evacuated its New York City bureau, citing a report of a suspicious device.
White House has responded.
“We condemn the attempted violent attacks recently made against President Obama, President Clinton, Secretary Clinton, and other public figures,” White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement.
“These terrorizing acts are despicable, and anyone responsible will be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law.”
The FBI’s New York field office said in a tweet that its Joint Terrorism Task Force has engaged with the federal, state and local partners to investigate the package sent to the Clintons.
