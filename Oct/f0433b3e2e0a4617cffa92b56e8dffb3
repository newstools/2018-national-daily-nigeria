Cristiano Ronaldo should always be the front-runner to win the Ballon d’Or, according to former Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti.

Ronaldo and Lionel Messi have dominated the award for a decade, claiming the trophy five times each, but they face stiff competition for the prize in 2018.

Madrid midfielder Luka Modric was named the FIFA Best Men’s Player following his Champions League triumph and awarded the Golden Ball for his star performances in Croatia’s run to the World Cup final, while Antoine Griezmann and Mohamed Salah have also been touted as contenders.

“I am grateful to Ronaldo, regardless of the goals he scored to win the Champions League at Madrid,” Ancelotti said.

“I am happy that he plays in Italy now, he is an added value to every team, I think he should always win the Ballon d’Or.”

Ancelotti went on to insist that Napoli’s game against the Serie A champions should not be viewed as a battle between their respective star names.
