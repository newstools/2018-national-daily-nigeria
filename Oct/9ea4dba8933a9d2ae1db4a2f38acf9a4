The Lagos State Building Control Agency (LASBCA) has given a seven-day ultimatum to owners of distressed buildings across the state to demolish them or bear the risk and cost of their demolition by the agency.
The LASBCA General Manager, Mr. Olalekan Shodeinde, gave the ultimatum on Monday in Lagos.
Shodeinde said that LASBCA had identified and marked some distressed buildings for demolition in some areas of the state.
According to him, at the expiration of the ultimatum, LASBCA would demolish the buildings in accordance with the Lagos State Physical and Urban Planning Development Law, 2010.
Shodehinde warned that owners of such buildings would pay the demolition cost to the state government within 90 days, failure of which the government would confiscate the land.
The general manager said that the government had zero tolerance for distressed buildings.
He said that the ultimatum was given within the ambit of the law with a view to ensuring a better physical environment for sustainable development.
“In the pursuit for zero tolerance for building collapse, the state government has given owners of distressed buildings seven days’ grace to demolish the buildings or bear the risk of their demolition by the agency.
“People have shown disregard for laws on building construction in the past, and the resultant effects are worrisome.
“Sustainable physical development requires the participation of all residents, whose interests are affected and co-operation necessary for successful implementation of laws and regulations,” he said.
He said that partially-collapsed building would be demolished soon to prevent loss of lives and property.
“Many distressed buildings in the state are disasters waiting to happen, but the agency is committed to preventing them by pulling the buildings down to avoid the collapse that could cause more damage,” he said.
