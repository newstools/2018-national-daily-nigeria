French President, Emmanuel Macron, has reportedly been told that he is too arrogant by his own wife, Brigitte.
Mrs. Macron, who claims she is fed up of his high-handed manner, has urged his inner circle to tell him the truth because she feels like she is the only person who is bold enough to tell him the truth, reports Daily Mail.
Quoting local media, Daily Mail said, Brigitte confided in members of her entourage that President Macron is ‘too arrogant, too snappy’, and nobody dares tell him otherwise.
This comes as a new book revealed Mrs Macron has allegedly vowed find out the person, who started whispers that her husband was secretly in a gay relationship.
Macron has recently been facing struggles of his own as he grapples to reshuffle his government following the resignation of two ministers.
One of the two ministers claimed that his presidency ‘lacked humility’.
