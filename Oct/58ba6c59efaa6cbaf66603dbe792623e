Ifeanyi Udeh, an adulterated wine producer arrested at Agbowa, Ikorodu, Lagos, has insisted that the wine isn’t harmful, as he also drinks it.
The suspect was paraded by the Lagos State Commissioner of Police, CP Edgal Imohimi, on Monday. .
“He was producing the wines in his one room apartment without getting the right approval from the concerned authority,” Edgal said. .

The suspect, Ifeanyi, while lamenting and pleading for forgiveness, however, admitted committing the offence.
He said, he understands that he has committed a crime by producing the wines without getting approval from the right authority. .
According to him; “I would have gotten NAFDAC approval but because I could not afford it, so I decided to do little business to raise money to get the approval.
The drinks are not harmful, I also drink it and nothing happens to us. The only mistake I made is by not getting the approval, if I am forgiven on this, I will do the right thing and do the business in a legal way. .
I don’t have the means to produce the wines in a big form, so I was doing it in my room. I was arrested while trying to distribute the ones I made.”
