Governor Waziri Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto State visited former President Olusegun Obasanjo on Wednesday night in Abeokuta, Ogun State, where he held closed- door meeting with the former President at his residence. Tambuwal visited the former President about 48 hours to the commencement of the National Convention of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, to nominate the party’s presidential candidate for the 2019 general elections.
National Daily gathered that Tambuwal in a media interaction after the meeting which ended few minutes to 9.00p.m admitted that he was in Abeokuta to consult with Obasanjo on the 2019 presidential election which is aspiring for the ticket of the PDP.
The Sokoto State Governor had declared: “Obasanjo is one of the critical leaders of the country and it is necessary for me to consult with him concerning the 2019 polls, particularly, on my aspiration to contest for the presidency of Nigeria.”
Tambuwal was said to have indicated optimism that Nigeria could still attain greater and enviable height particularly if the citizens vote rightly in the 2019 polls.
The Governor advocated that every part of the country should be given an opportunity and sense of belonging in the Nigerian project. He further admonished political leaders to eschew from making the 2019 elections “do or die” affairs.
Tambuwal advocated more participation of youths in the governance of Nigeria, stating that the agitation for youth participation in politics is justified.
