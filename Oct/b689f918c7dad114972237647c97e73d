Reports in Portugal state Cristiano Ronaldo won’t play for the national team until 2019, so he’ll miss matches against Italy, Poland, and Scotland.
The Juventus striker wasn’t called-up for the Nations League games in September, as he focused on adapting to the Bianconeri.
Now O Jogo is reporting that CR7 has asked not to be selected for the October or November international breaks, so he won’t play for his country until 2019.
Ronaldo would therefore miss a Nations League game with Poland this month, as well as a friendly with Scotland in Glasgow.
In November, Portugal face Poland again and then take on Italy, but the Juve man is expected to miss both of those.
