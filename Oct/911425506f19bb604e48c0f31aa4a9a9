Another politician, Michael Adedeji, a member of the Ekiti state House of Assembly, who was shot in the head by gunmen on Friday has died.
The attack on Adedeji is the third on top politicians in the state in the last three months. In August, Bunmi Ojo, an associate of Segun Oni, a former governor of the state, was shot dead in Ado-Ekiti.
Two weeks ago, Moses Adeoye, treasurer of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state, was killed at his residence.
Jackson Adebayo, publicity secretary of the Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP) in the state, confirmed this on Monday.
According to Adebayo, the lawmaker died at the Federal Medical Center, Ido Ekiti, early this morning, adding that the party would release a statement on the development later in the day.
Adedeji, a member of the PDP, was attacked while traveling along Ikere-Akure road.
Caleb Ikechukwu, spokesman of the Ekiti police command, could not be reached for comments as of the time this report was filed.
