Says Atiku will win  




Reverend Father Ejike Mbaka, Founder of Adoration Ministry in Enugu State, on Sunday stated that Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, Candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) will defeat President Muhammadu Buhari of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the 2019 presidential election.
Mbaka was said to have admonished Atiku not to repeat the failures of Buhari when he gets to office.
Mbaka condemned the high cost of purchasing the nomination forms of the ruling APC for the party’s primary elections across the country, decrying that some members went out their ways to raise the money. “There are some people that sold their land to pay for this form because of the promise they were made. I don’t think these politicians were thinking of heaven that is why they are ready to kill anybody that stands on their way,” Mbaka remarked
The Reverend Father was of the view that President Buhari disobeyed God who put him on the throne, and perhaps, the throne has been taken away from him. He further observed that President Buhari did not make right appointments so as to bring on board Nigerians who have the capacity to develop- the country. “There are no people that will develop this country that are not in Nigeria. We have people who will develop this nation; but our President left the same type of people who don’t have the same type of vision around him and everything they do is in your head.
“After you are removed, they will bring people that will flog you because you messed up the opportunities because you didn’t listen to the word of God. You didn’t listen to the man of God you have and you were disobeying him. The price of disobedience is disgrace,” Mbaka declared.
