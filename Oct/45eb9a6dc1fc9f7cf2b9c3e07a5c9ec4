Sol Campbell has been asked to get involved in the FA’s coaching set-up by U21s manager Aidy Boothroyd, National daily understands.
England U21s have two European Qualifiers against Andorra and Scotland later this month, and they need just one point to guarantee qualification for next summer’s finals in Italy and San Marino.
However, it is thought former England international Campbell will not join up with the squad until November, ahead of the friendly games against Germany and Italy.
The former Arsenal and Spurs defender is keen to forge a future for himself as a manager.
But the 44-year-old was overlooked by Oxford when they had a vacancy in February, and has spoken out about his frustration at the lack of opportunities in the game.
It is understood that, at this stage, Campbell is unlikely to become a full-time FA employee.
However, both he and Boothroyd are keen to see how the coaching arrangement works – after he has been involved with the U21s for a short-term trial period.
