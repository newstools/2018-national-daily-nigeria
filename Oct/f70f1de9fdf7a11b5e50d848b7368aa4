There were a total of 3,274 accredited delegates, with Datti Baba-Ahmed getting five votes and rooted to the bottom of the table.
In a reaction via his official Twitter handle, Atiku commended the PDP and all its members for choosing him as the flag-bearer ahead of the 2019 presidential election, adding that his victory is for all Nigerians.
He said: “@OfficialPDPNig, thank you for choosing me. This is a victory for all of us. The task to get Nigeria working again starts now. #NigeriaWillWork #LetsGetNigeriaWorkingAgain.”
He is expected to provide stiff competition to President Muhammadu Buhari who emerged as the All Progressives Congress presidential candidate.
