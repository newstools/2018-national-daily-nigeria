Karim Benzema and Marcelo scored as under-pressure Real Madrid head coach Julen Lopetegui saw his team beat Viktoria Plzen 2-1 for their first win in six.

Lopetegui is rumoured to be on the brink of the sack at the Santiago Bernabeu after a dismal run in all competitions, but there was a timely victory for the reigning Champions League holders on Tuesday, albeit in unconvincing fashion.

While Plzen largely gave as good as they got, the recalled Benzema crucially broke the deadlock, scoring in a 14th consecutive Champions League season with a powerful early header.

A second from Marcelo followed, yet Patrik Hrosovsky pulled a goal back and Barcelona, Madrid’s next opponents, would certainly have identified weaknesses ahead of El Clasico, which could have a huge bearing on Lopetegui’s future.
