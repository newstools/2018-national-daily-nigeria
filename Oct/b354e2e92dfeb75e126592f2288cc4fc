Andrés Iniesta and the Japanese sports brand ASICS have presented the sponsorship agreement signed by both parties and which makes Iniesta an ambassador of ASICS in the football market. After finishing this summer a long and successful relationship with NIKE, Iniesta will wear the sportswear and will wear the football boots of the Japanese firm.
Andrés Iniesta: “I am extremely excited to be part of the ASICS family, a brand that represents values and convictions similar to mine as an athlete. I am committed to inspiring other people to move more, as well as promoting the game from base levels in Japan to reduce the differences between Asian football and the rest of the world. I think this movement is another positive step to achieve this goal. ” Motoi OYAMA, President and CEO, Corporate Representative of ASICS Corporation: “We are excited to work with Iniesta for his incredible talent and inspiration to the industry and fans around the world. Everything that Iniesta defends both on and off the field, makes it fit perfectly not only with the ASICS football line, but also as an ambassador of our brand under the philosophy of ASICS rooted in our motto I MOVE ME ™. ASICS has already experienced great success in the football category with the sponsorship of Vissel-Kobe and we hope to continue with this sponsorship agreement. ”
The ASICS brand was founded in 1949 by Kihachiro Onitsuka in Kobe, although it did not adopt the name of ASICS until 1977. Throughout its history, ASICS has been characterized as a leading technology company, standing out in the world of track athletics and the running.
