As Court directs EFCC to investigate APC chairman




The National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, may be facing fresh crisis as a Federal High Court sitting in Abuja on Tuesday delivered judgment on a suit seeking to compel the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, to investigate the former Governor of Edo State over allegations of financial impropriety.
The Presiding Judge, in the judgment, directed the EFCC to investigate the APC national chairman over the petition of corruption sent by Bishop Osadolor Ochei.
Justice Anwuli Chikere delivering judgment on a corruption allegation suit by Bishop Osadolor Ochei against Oshiomhole, ordered that the hydgment should be served on the Commission within five days from October 9th that the judgment was delivered.
National Daily gathered that West Idahosa, Counsel to the plaintiff, remarked that they have 86 exhibits to prove their case, including pictorial evidence of houses belonging to the former governor which he could not have acquired through his earnings.
The case was adjourned to 23rd October 2018 when all parties are expected to present their arguments.
Ochei recalled that the petition was sent in 2016 to the EFCC against the former APC governor in Edo State, now APC national chairman, but the Commission took no action; neither did the federal government which is fighting corruption consider any action also.
“On May 4, 2012, one Matthew Edaghese sent a petition to the EFCC, complaining that while serving as governor, Oshiomhole built mansions on a huge expanse of land worth more than N10 billion, in excess of the former governor’s legitimate means of income as governor,” he had remarked, decrying that EFCC declined action on the petition. This was said to compel the court action.
