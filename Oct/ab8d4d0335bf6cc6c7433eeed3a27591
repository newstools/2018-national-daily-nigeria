The Nigeria Amputee Football World team, Special Eagles, will open their World Cup group stage campaign on October 28 against Brazil Amputees,National Daily learnt.
According to the games schedule released by the Local Organising Commitee of Mexico 2018 Amputee Football World Cup, their second game will be against defending champions Russia on October 29, while their last group opponent will be El Salvador on October 30.
Though the amputees are still campaigning for public funding support to enable them attend the World Cup after missing three previous editions for lack of funds, the team has remained in high spirits, trusting on the understanding and love of the Nigerian public.
Having not received response yet from both government and various corporate organisations on their request for sponsorship, the amputees launched a public funding appeal with just three weeks to go for the competition.
While support have started trickling in, they got a major boost on last Friday with the NFF President, Amaju Pinnick, announcing a solidarity support of N2.5m and additional $5,000.
The contingent of 15 amputee players and five officials require about N40m to prosecute the Amputee World Cup campaign.
This includes about N15m for their return ticket to Mexico, purchase of standard amputee sports equipment, medical supplies, upkeep, allowances to the players and other logistics.
