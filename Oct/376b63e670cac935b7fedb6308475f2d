We will ensure that little lapses noticed during the previous playoffs will be corrected in the Division 3 playoff,” Ogunnowo said.
He added: “That is the standard that the board has given to the secretariat, that will ensure the little errors are corrected. Although these errors were not visible to the public, but we noticed the errors and it is our aim to fix the errors and have a smooth organisation of the Division 3 playoff.
