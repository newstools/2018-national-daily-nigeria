The Oba of Lagos, Rilwan Akiolu, says Governor Akinwunmi of Lagos state is a good man, adding that his inability to secure a second term as governor of the state is not as a result of being a failure but rather due to circumstances beyond his control.
Recall that leaders of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Lagos had rejected Ambode’s second term bid, throwing their weight instead behind Sanwo-Olu who eventually emerged the party’s governorship candidate at the party’s primaries.
Akiolu said no evil will befall Ambode despite his rejection by party members in the state.
“I know he’s a good person,” the oba said.
“No evil will befall him and God still has great plans for him (Ambode). When the breeze blows, we will all see what the chicken is hiding underneath.
“The truth is that if Bola Ahmed Tinubu is angry, he’s justified. No evil will befall the three of them. They know my stance on the issue and it’s not a secret.
“Better people should come into politics, because majority of them there are liars and that is the truth. As time goes on, we will continue to de-emphasise the import of money in our election.
“On the other hand, concerning Ambode, if you have charm but you don’t have the antidote or another charm that can counter it, then you don’t have anything. I won’t say more than that. May God help all of us.
“So, I didn’t talk because they are both my children and it will get better.”
The influential monarch also advised President Muhammadu Buhari to prevent former President Olusegun Obasanjo from “escaping” if he wins reelection in 2019.
“The moment he wins the election, he should close the border so that Obasanjo won’t escape,” the Oba said.
“Obasanjo should change his ways. An adage says that a deity that we try every possible thing to put in a place of honour that defies all such gestures would expose itself to ridicule at the end of the day.”
