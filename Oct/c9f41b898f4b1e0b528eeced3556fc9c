After excelling in two matches as Super Eagles’ stand-in captain, against Libya in back-to-back Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers, Musa was meant to head straight to Saudi Arabia, but he has opted to do otherwise.

National Daily gathered that Musa’s initial plan had been to move straight to his base from Sfax in Tunisia, where he scored one of Nigeria’s goals in a 3-2 away victory.

However, Musa eventually decided to do otherwise, and will now miss Al-Nassr’s Saudi Super League match away to Al Batin, as he attends to some personal matters in Nigeria.

Musa is said to have traveled by road on Wednesday to the city in which he grew up, Jos in Plateau State, to visit his mother after he returned to Abuja with the Eagles same morning.

Al-Nassr, who are top of the Saudi League table with 15 points from five matches, will for the first time this season now be without Musa, who has scored four goals in five games.
