The President of the Senate and Presidential Aspirant of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Dr. Abubakar Bukola Saraki, on Monday, expressed sadness the death of Senator David Dafinone, though, eulogising the foremost accountant for his immense contribution to the development of old Bendel State, in particular, and the country, in general.
Saraki, in a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Yusuph Olaniyonu, described the late elder-statesman as a highly talented professional, politician and community leader, who dedicated his entire lifetime to the upliftment of humanity.
He said that the late Dafinone did not only live an exemplary lifestyle worthy of emulation, he made history by inspiring every member of his nuclear family to qualify as a Chartered Accountant, thereby, entering the Guinness Book of Records as the family with the highest number of chartered accountants.
“Little wonder that in 2006, he received a ‘definite entry’ in the Cambridge Blue Book for an outstanding contribution in the field of accountancy,” Saraki remarked.
He maintained: “Apart from his immediate family, his contributions to the accountancy profession and the socio-political advancement of the country remains legendary.
“He was a success both in the boardroom and in politics. I remember his stint in the Senate at a time my late father was the Senate Leader. His contributions on the floor and during committee meetings were always borne out of patriotism and desire for a better Nigeria. He was an example of the substance and calibre of men who occupied the first and second Senate.”
Saraki commiserated with the immediate family of the deceased, the government and people of Delta State, the Accountancy profession, the private sector and the country at large over the sad loss.
He prayed God to grant the soul of the deceased eternal bliss and his family and loved ones the fortitude to bear the loss.
