Chelsea forward, Eden Hazard reportedly influenced Real Madrid’s backing off from appointing former Blues boss, Antonio Conte, as the team’s manager.
Hazard requested the club not to put the Italian in charge at the Bernabeu.
This claim was made by respected Spanish journalist, Eduardo Inda.
Real Madrid had yesterday announced the departure of Julen Lopetegui after just four and a half months in charge.
He was “provisionally replaced” by ex-player and manager of Real Madrid Castilla, Santiago Solari.
Many had expected Conte to step in after he held talks with club president, Florentino Perez.
However, the proposed deal seems to have stalled and Inda said Hazard was behind it.
The Belgian has long been linked with a switch to the Bernabeu but Chelsea opted not to cash in on him last summer.
Hazard has made no secret of his desire to secure a ‘dream’ move to the Spanish capital but it appears he isn’t keen on a reunion with Conte.
Inda told Express Sports that the winger has indirectly communicated with Madrid that he “would never sign” for the club if Conte was appointed.
Madrid are set to return for Hazard in January and know they’d have no chance of convincing him to leave west London if Conte was in charge.
Hazard and Conte spent two years together at Chelsea, and while appearing to get on during their time at Stamford Bridge, the former has since criticised his ex-manager.
The 27-year-old had insisted that he prefers playing under Maurizio Sarri and was also reportedly not comfortable with the role and position he played under Conte.
