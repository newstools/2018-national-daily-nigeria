The China-based Super Eagles striker, Odion Ighalo, who helped Nigeria secure a win over Libya in the African cup of Nations qualifiers, told National Daily recently that he
was criticized and abused by fans following a poor performance at the world cup that made him almost quit national team.
He explained that  he would’ve quit the S.Eagles after the world cup, if not for the intervention of coach Gernot Rohr.
￼He said that he almost retired from the National team saying fans went overboard by sending death threats to him and his family.
￼Things went  bad, Ighalo said, that he came this close to packing it all in.
“I know the fans want me to score goals.
￼“They said a lot of things. To my innocent kids, to my wife, even to the extent they threatened my life and the life of my family.
” Despite trying to remain above it all and not responding to critics, I was deeply hurt by the attacks on my family, especially my children.
￼“My wife said ‘you don’t have to go there [to Nigeria] anymore’ and it was because of all what they said to her and to our family.”
He noted that Rohr’s faith in him made him reverse his decision and he has silenced his critics with fine performances in all the three matches he has played for the Eagles after the world cup.
“ I know you are a good goalscorer and I know you can do it. Come and show them that you can score,” he quoted the coach as saying.
