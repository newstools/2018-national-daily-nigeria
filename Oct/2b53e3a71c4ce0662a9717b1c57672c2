The African Action Congress party has sadly announced the lose of three members from the Delta State AAC family. The men were returning from an outreach effort related to State AAC activities when their car fell into a river on a particularly bad stretch of road that has claimed many lives in the past.

“At this dark time, we mourn the loss of these brave men, and ask all of our members to pray that their patriotic and revolutionary souls rest in peace. The deceased include Pastor Jones Abushe, Mr. Edris Sani, and Mr. Ernest Omamode Ojegba – all of them people who were tired of the status quo in their state and seeking to bring about positive transformation”

The party also used the opportunity to remember and pray for their families ‘that they might find the strength to bear this tragic loss’.

In a post made on Omoyele Sowore  facebook page they stated the need to continue in the ‘rise and seek for better infrastructure, better care for our citizens, and more value to human lives even as we grieve’

May the souls of the dearly departed rest in peace.
