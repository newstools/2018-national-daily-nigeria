The Management of Ikeja Electricity Distraction Company, IKEDC, has revealed the commencement of distribution of over 850,000 prepaid meters to its consumers in its six business units in Lagos. This was said to be a renewed commitment to satisfy the yearnings of customers and close the metering gap within its network.



The IKEDC’s Corporate Communication Officer, Felix Ofulue, indicated that the Company is abiding with the regulator’s guideline which states that all customers have a right to properly installed and functional meter.
He said that the regulator’s guidelines also stipulate that un-metered customer should be issued with electricity bills strictly based on Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission’s (NERC) estimated billing methodology.
Ofulue said that the roll out would cover residential customers across its six Business Units, in its first batch of renewed metering drive, reiterating that the Company remains resolute in its commitment to provide meters to all its customers and narrow the metering gap as quickly as possible.
“Ikeja Electric wants to reassure customers and state clearly its plans to progressively reduce estimated billing thereby building customers trust in our services.
“At the moment, prepaid meters are being installed in different communities across the network, while in other localities, pre-installation activities are ongoing and between now and the end of the year we will have concluded the first batch of the deployment. We therefore urge our customers to be patient as our ultimate objective is to ensure that all our customers are eventually metered.” Ofulue said.
Ofulue assured customers in Ikeja, Abule-Egba, Akowonjo, Oshodi, Ikorodu and Shomolu who had indicated their eagerness would be issued meters, adding that the organization was adding its quota in narrowing the metering gap.
