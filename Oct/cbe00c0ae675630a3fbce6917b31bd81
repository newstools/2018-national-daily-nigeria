“My major aims and objectives is to always fish out good players from the grassroots that will make name for themselves and this country, and God has been helping me.

“I must also appreciate the GM of the academy (Funsho) and all my wonderful coaches like Mohamed, Bale Amosa, Bolaji and Laaro for their supports always,” Unuanel explained.
