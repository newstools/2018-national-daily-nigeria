VINCENT KOMPANY is set to swap captaincy for classrooms – by becoming a language teacher.
The Manchester City and Belgium skipper, born in Brussels to French-speaking parents, has gone on to learn Dutch, English and German.
Kompany has recently teamed up with the capital city’s employment service Actiris to urge locals to learn Dutch.
And the 32-year-old has now offered jobless French speakers the prize of a language lesson taught by himself.
The centre-back appears on a website named I Learn Flemish With Vincent, wearing a T-shirt reading “Le Prof”.
He said: “I hope I can inspire young jobseekers to learn Dutch via Actiris, and increase their chances of finding work.
“I think it is important that the campaign has taken a step forward following its success last year.”
Nine competition entrants will be chosen next month to receive the personal lesson from Kompany.
Meanwhile, Kompany and his fellow City team-mates have been teaching the footballing world a lesson in defence – having conceded just THREE goals this season.
Pep Guardiola’s side, who drew 0-0 at Liverpool on Sunday, have the best defensive record in Europe’s top five leagues.
The last time they conceded a Premier League goal was at home to Newcastle on September 1.
