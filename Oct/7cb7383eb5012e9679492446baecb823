Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Angel Di Maria has backed team-mate Kylian Mbappe to one day win the Ballon d’Or.

Di Maria does not believe it will be long before the striker is being touted for such success.

“If he continues at this level, he can win it in any year,” he told TF1’s ‘Telefoot’ program. “We see in each of his matches the potential that he has – he exploits it every time, even if he is only 19.”

Meanwhile, the Argentine says that Neymar is now back to his best after an injury that saw his campaign ended prematurely and hampered his efforts at the World Cup.

“He’s the same as he was before his injury, driven by his great ambition,” he continued.

Di Maria might have been linked with a move away from PSG in the summer, but he has enjoyed increased game time since Thomas Tuchel arrived to coach the club and has been one of their outstanding performers of the season to date.
