Eight-time African champion Blessing Oborududu and her namesake, Blessing Onyebuchi – a 2018 Commonwealth silver medalist, on Sunday morning arrived Budapest, Hungary ahead of their participation at the ongoing 2018 Senior World Wrestling Championships.



The duo will be joined by sensational Odunayo Adekuoroye, who narrowly missed winning a gold medal for Nigeria at the event last year, Commonwealth champion Aminat Adeniyi and coach Purity Akuh, who are all expected to arrive Budapest on Monday aboard a Turkish Airline flight.
After over a month of intensive camping in Yenagoa, Bayelsa State, the all-female quartet of Adekuoroye, Oborududu, Adeniyi and Onyebuchi will be hoping to do Nigeria proud in Hungary when they begin competition on Tuesday.

Also in Budapest is president of the Nigeria Wrestling Federation Hon. Daniel Igali, who arrived earlier to be part of the United World Wrestling Congress.
The 2018 Senior World Wrestling Championships which started on 20th October will come to an end on 28th October.
