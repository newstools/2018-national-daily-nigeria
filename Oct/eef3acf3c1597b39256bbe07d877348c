Former Super Eagles goalkeeper, Peter Rufai has called on Sports Lovers not to blame national team Safe-hand , Francis Uzoho for his shaky performance against Libya in the AFCON 2019 qualifier, rather the blame should be on the coaching crew of the Super Eagles.
The former Deportivo la Coruna of Spain goalie revealed  that Uzoho is a talent for the future and needs very serious nurturing rather than being thrown into very top competitive level in the national team.
Rufai explained that  Rohr led coaching crew to carefully re-assess the goalkeeping department of the Eagles noting that there are a lot of talented goalkeepers in Nigeria who can make the goalkeeping department more competitive than it is at the moment.
He concluded that  after a shaky start which was a 2-0 loss to South Africa in the opening game of the qualifier, the Eagles have gone on a 3-match winning streak and presently top the group with 9 points.
