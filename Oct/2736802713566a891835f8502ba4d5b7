The unease between the executive and the legislative arms of government has cone to the fore in a manner Nigerians might not have witnessed in recent times: Senate President Bukola Saraki and Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara, are both absent at Eagle Square Abuja on Nigeria’s 58th Independence Day.
Ony President Muhammadu Buhari, his V. Yemi Osinbajo, Chief Justice of Nigeria Walter Onnoghen and former Head of State Yakubu Gowon that graced the anniversary.
Saraki and Dogara left the ruling APC for the PDP where the former is seeking a ticket to run for presidency, and the latter a return to the House.
The two left the APC in high huff few weeks ago, and many believe the defection heightened the hostility between Buhari and Saraki whom the party members believe is eyeing the No. 1 seat.
As usual, the celebration was marked by a ceremonial parade comprising of the Armed Forces, police and other para-military agencies, and a show of Nigeria’s military hardware as well as air displays.
There will also be a photo exhibition telling the Nigerian history and an Independence Day dinner.
