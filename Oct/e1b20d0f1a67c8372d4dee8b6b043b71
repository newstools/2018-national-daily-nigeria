Turin-based club- Juventus will try to attract Kylian Mbappé or Paul Pogba as their next superstar signing.
The Bianconeri broke from their traditional business model to sign Cristiano Ronaldo for €100m this summer, on a reported salary of €30m per season.
It’s believed that disagreements over that strategy may be behind the departure of general manager Giuseppe Marotta, who has previously been more frugal in the transfer market.
President Andrea Agnelli has said previously that the aim is to get the next superstar at a younger age, and today Tuttosport reports that could mean Mbappé, or a return for Pogba.
Juve have no chance of signing the former in the near future, but it’s hoped that he may want to move out of Ligue 1 toward the end of his contract in 2022.
Mbappé would represent an ideal replacement for Ronaldo, and he would fit the bill as a superstar signing.
The other option, Pogba, is more likely in the short-to-medium term as he’s unhappy at Manchester United.
Barcelona are also interested, but the Frenchman played the best football of his career in Turin and could well be tempted to return.
