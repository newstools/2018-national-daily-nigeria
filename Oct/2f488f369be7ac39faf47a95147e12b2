Super Eagles midfielder, Wilfred Ndidi, has expressed sadness over the death of Leicester City chairman, Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha.
Srivaddhanaprabha was among five people killed in a helicopter crash on Saturday night.
The 60-year-old Thai businessman was on board his personal helicopter, which lost control and crashed in a car park at the King Power Stadium, following Saturday’s 1-1 draw with West Ham.
“You were far too kind and supportive.
“Thank you for all you did for the club, for always encouraging the team and coming all the way to watch me play at the World Cup.
“Rest on sir #theboss,” Ndidi, who scored the equalizer for the Foxes in the game, wrote on his Instagram page.
