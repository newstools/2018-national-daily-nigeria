Diego Maradona has reiterated his belief that countryman Lionel Messi is the best player in the world.
The Argentine seemed to take aim at the Barcelona star last weekend, when he appeared to question the way that the 31-year-old is deified.
Maradona, in particular, took aim at Messi’s mentality, claiming that he is not a leader.
he was cited as having accused the Barca ace of “going to the bathroom 20 times before a game”.
The Dorados head coach, however, has said that his comments were taken out of context and accused the media of driving a wedge between himself and the player he once led as Argentina coach.
“I know who Leo is, I know he’s the best player in the world,” he said on Sunday. “If I said a player goes to the toilet 20 times before a game, I never named Lionel Messi.
“They want to put me into confrontation with Messi but they cannot. The friendship I have with Lionel is bigger than anything they can write, and I’m saying that he’s the greatest in the world.
