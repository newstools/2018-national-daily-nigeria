Former Manchester United star Paul Scholes has once more taken aim at his ex-employers, stating that even Lionel Messi would fail to revive their failing fortunes.
United currently lie a lowly eighth in the Premier League, seven points behind early pace-setters Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester City after losing three of their opening eight fixtures.
That run of inauspicious form has coincided with pressure being mounted on manager Jose Mourinho, with reports that relations between the boss and certain first-team players have taken a nose dive.
And Scholes believes that morale is so low at Old Trafford right now that the task of turning things around would be too much even for Barcelona’s wizard.
“I feel like we could sign Lionel Messi at the moment and he’d struggle in this team.”
