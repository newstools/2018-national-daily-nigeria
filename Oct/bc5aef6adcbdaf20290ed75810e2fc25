Osun United Football Club strengthened their position on the Bet9ja Nigeria National League Group B2 Table Log, as Jide Apena’s second half goal earned them a 1-0 home win over Rovers Football Club.

After a slow start at the Oshogbo Township Stadium, the Omoluabi Giants had to wait until the 48th minute to find a way through the Ayade Boys stubborn backline.

Osun United took early control of midfield with Rovers content to sit deep and eliminate the threat of counter attacks from Victor Okeji, Ahmed Rasheed, Alaji Rasaq and Hakeem Olalere.

Rovers offered their own danger in the 6th minute, when John David, raced towards goal and Osun United were thankful their goalkeeper Ayo Ojo, was alert to snuff out the danger.

There was moment of drama in the 45th minute, with end to end stuff, following a superb goal line clearance from United captain Suraj Sodiq. Rasheed missed a sitter for Osun United following a great assist from Okeji.

Outstanding Michael Okolo was the architect of United’s goal with a brilliant set piece delivery from the right, and Apena made no mistake in nodding home his second goal of the campaign.

Rover’s Ndukwu Junior, cut in the 69th minute from the left and unleashed a rasping drive which was confidently saved by Ayo Ojo.

Osun United are now 7th on the log, having garnered 20 points and will be guest to relegation threatened Dynamite Force Football Club on Wednesday October 17, 2018.
