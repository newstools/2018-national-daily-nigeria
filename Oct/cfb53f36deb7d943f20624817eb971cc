Coach Gernot Rohr revealed that he is proud of Nigeria’s performance against Libya match yesterday, Africa Cup of Nations qualification clash.

The Super Eagles had gone two goals up in the opening 17 minutes courtesy Odion Ighalo and Ahmed Musa before the hosts even scores.

Mohamed Zubya headed home in the 35th minute before Ahmad Benali completed the comeback in the 74th minute.

And when it looked like result would end on a no winner, no vanquished note, Ighalo sealed the victory with his 81st-minute strike – his second of the game.

Nonetheless, the German tactician feels the tie was a good test for his team and disclosed that his team will keep fighting until an Afcon ticket is secured.

“I congratulate my team for this victory.” Rohr told National Daily .

“We lost a two-goal lead but fought hard instead of dropping our heads. We will stay humble because we have not qualified for Afcon yet. We keep fighting.”

With this result, the three-time African champions top Group E with nine points after three matches.

They face South Africa in their next encounter on 16 November, while Seychelles welcome Libya to Victoria.
