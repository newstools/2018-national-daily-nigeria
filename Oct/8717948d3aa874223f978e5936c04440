Real Madrid and Spain captain Sergio Ramos believes Tottenham star Harry Kane has the ability to flourish in LaLiga.
Two-time Premier League Golden Boot winner Kane has been linked with a move to European champions Madrid in recent years.
Kane has scored five league goals for Tottenham this season and Ramos singled out the England star ahead of Monday’s blockbuster Nations League clash in Seville.
Asked who from the England team had the technical quality to succeed in Spain, Ramos said: “They’re all really impressive.
“It’s true that what shines the most in the Premier League is the physical form but they have players with lots of quality.
“Harry Kane for example is a really physical striker but also really skilful, he surprises lot of defenders but he won’t surprise me.
“They have many other strikers that are really dangerous and unbalancing, I can assure you we have studied them really well so they won’t do their best.”
Kane, who won the World Cup’s Golden Boot, has gone six matches without an international goal following England’s dour scoreless draw against Croatia .
