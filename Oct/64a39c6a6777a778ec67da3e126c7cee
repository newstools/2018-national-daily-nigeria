Reno Omokri, an Aide to former President Goodluck Jonathan, in a clinical review of the October 1 Presidential Independence Day broadcast, highlights that President Muhammadu Buhari’s Independence Day broadcast was full of lies.
“I will now expose each lie with facts and figures to back up my expositions. I feel sorry for those who say Buhari has ‘integrity’. Does a man of integrity tell so many lies,” Omokri declared.

He listed the lies with proofs as follows;

“There has been a steady improvement in the security situation in the North East”

A lie. The situation in the NE has deteriorated seriously. Almost a hundred soldiers have died in 2018. Boko Haram has attacked and overran barracks twice this year

“We are diversifying away from reliance on oil to increased manufacturing capacity”

Lie. Manufacturing capacity has reduced 28% from 2015 levels. @Google it. We are dependent on foreign loans. Buhari has borrowed more than any other in our history

#BuhariIndependenceDayLies

‪“Efforts are on course in the Niger Delta to clean up polluted lands”

Another BIG LIE. two years after @ProfOsinbajo flagged off Ogoni Cleanup, not a drop of oil has been cleaned. Instead, a maritime university meant for the Niger Delta was scrapped

#BuhariIndependenceDayLies

‪“Conflict between herders and farmers is being addressed decisively.”

Lie. On June 26, Buhari himself said “There is nothing I can do to help the situation except to pray”, when he visited Plateau after herdsmen killed hundreds of Nigerians there.

#BuhariIndependenceDayLies

 “We are making progress in the fight against corruption.”

Lie. According to Transparency International, Nigeria is now more corrupt today than she was in 2015 and made her worst ever retrogression on the CPI moving 12 steps backward from 136 to 148

#BuhariIndependenceDayLies

“There is now an enabling environment for local and foreign investment in Nigeria.”

Lie. There is a capital flight out of Nigeria. Nigeria is not in this year’s top 10 highest recipients of FDI in Africa. In 2013-14 we were number One. Google it

#BuhariIndependenceDayLies

“We are gradually strengthening the economy with a stable Naira”.

Lie: The Naira is not stable. S & P rated Naira the worst performing currency in Africa in 2016 and one of the worst in the world in 2017 and has lost 82% of its 2015 value. It is classified as a volatile currency and is not accepted in Europe and South Africa.

#BuhariIndependenceDayLies

‪“Our youths have been at the vanguard of the struggle”

Lie. President @MBuhari told the Commonwealth of Nations on April 18, 2018 in London that ‘Nigerian youth are lazy, uneducated’. It was caught on video. His words then belie his words today

#BuhariIndependenceDayLies

“I have committed myself to ensure elections are fully participatory, free and fair”

Lie. Vote buying has increased in Nigeria under Buhari. The police routinely declare opposition candidates wanted days to elections and the APC chairman inadvertently admitted to rigging Osun election

#BuhariIndependenceDayLies

“At the international level, we remain a responsible and respected member of the international community”

Lie. Our President is NOT respected. President @RealDonaldTrump called him “lifeless”. He is considered a joke in the international community.

#BuhariIndependenceDayLies

“As President, I will continue to work tirelessly to promote, protect and preserve what really matters: unity”

Lie. Nigeria is more divided than at any time because @MBuhari continues to appoint mostly Northern Muslim Fulanis into sensitive positions

#BuhariIndependenceDayLies

Conclusion: I deal in facts. Everything I say is evidenced based. Buhari is a liar. A chronic and consistent liar and to say he has integrity is to insult people of integrity.
