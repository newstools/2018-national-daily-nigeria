the President of the Senate, Dr. Abubakar Bukola Saraki, on Monday ridiculed the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, the party’s obsession for the opposition Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, leaders. Saraki remarked that while APC leaders stoke civil war within the ruling party, they push the consequence of their incompetent leadership to the opposition PDP, always getting fretted with the rising profile of PDP leaders in the polity.
Yusuph Olaniyonu, Special Adviser on Media and Publicity to Senate President, in a statement in Abuja on Monday, declared: “We have noted the irresponsible statement issued by the APC spokesman, Yekinni Nabena. We know that he and the leadership of the APC are always incensed and disturbed at the mere hearing of the name, Saraki.
“It is also notable that Nabena and the APC are always concerned about the developments in the opposition party, the PDP.
“However, we believe that with the ‘civil war’ that Adams Oshiomhole and Yekinni Nabena have ignited in the APC and the very low level that they have dragged the party, in such manner that the ruling party is wallowing in confusion and disorganization, they have too much to pre-occupy them than to be poking their noses in what happens to Saraki or the PDP.”
