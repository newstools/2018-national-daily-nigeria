National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu is presently holding a meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari at the Presidential vIlla in Abuja.
Details of the meeting are still unknown but it might not be unconnected with Buhari’s trouble shooting efforts to calm frayed nerves over the conduct of the party’s primaries nationwide.
The president on Tuesday hosted aggrieved aspirants of the party to a dinner at the Presidential Villa.
Those in attendance at the dinner included aggrieved gubernatorial, National and State Assembly aspirants who failed to secure the party’s tickets in the forthcoming 2019 general elections.
The meeting was also attended by Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Mr Boss Mustapha, cabinet ministers and other presidential aides.
