Three presidential aspirants on Saturday night got the attention of the PDP leaders in their on-going convention, and the opposition is at sixes and sevens on who to support as PDP flagbearer for the 2019 presidential election.
Sokoto Governor Aminu Tambuwal, former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, and Senate President Bukola Saraki, in that order, are considered the major rivals in the primary.
buwalSen. Rabiu Kwakwanso, who many believed was the bride of the party because of his dalliance with former President Olusegun Obasanjo, appears a push-over as things stand now.
The leaders of the party had earlier met with all the aspirants at the Presidential Hotel, Port Harcourt, where the need for some of them to step down was discussed.
Among the aspirants seen at the hotel were Tambuwal, Saraki, and a former Governor of Plateau State, Senator Jonah Jang.
Other aspirants were said to have been part of the meeting which was also attended by majority of the 14 PDP governors.
Govs Ifeanyi Okowa and Dave Umahi were not involved because of their roles on the electoral committee.
Many of the party leaders, former presidents and some retired generals were supporting Tambuwal.
Tambuwal, who has the backing of the PDP governors, was considered based on his age, his reach and acceptability even beyond the PDP.
Atiku was said to have the backing of some members of the partyâ€™s Boards of Trustees and some former governors while Saraki was believed to have the backing of some senators and a few governors.
