There is major tension between Barcelonastars Leo Messi and Gerard Pique, it is being claimed.
El Chiringuito reports Pique is fed-up with Messi as a captain, believing he doesn’t take his media duties seriously.
A source says: “He (Pique) argues that Leo only speaks when he is out of Europe, with Argentina, and told him to come out and face the media.”
However, Messi has rejected the criticism and instead has blamed Pique for their inconsistent start to the season.
“He told him they are conceding too many goals and are not doing enough in defence.”
The pair have been close friends since their academy days, but it’s claimed there is now genuine tension between the two
