Antoine Griezmann created a little slice of Champions League history on Wednesday as he scored the competition’s 8,000th goal playing for Atletico Madrid.
The France striker has had a year to remember, taking Atletico to second place in La Liga before spearheading his nation’s charge to the World Cup title.
And, after Diego Simeone’s charges struggled in their Champions League group opener, they were back to their best on Wednesday to down Club Brugge 3-1.
As usual, Griezmann was among the goals, hitting 28 minutes in to cancel out an early lead for the Belgians before doubling his tally in the second half.
That goal, moreover, was the 8,000th in the history of the Champions League, while Koke went on to seal Atletico’s victory by making it 3-1 at the Wanda Metropolitano.
Griezmann therefore enters a distinguished group of players who have netted milestone goals since the European Cup was rebranded as the UEFA Champions League in 1992.
