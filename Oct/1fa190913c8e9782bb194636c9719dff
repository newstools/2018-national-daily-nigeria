Victor Moses is considering his Chelsea future after falling down the pecking order since Maurizio Sarri arrived at the club as head coach, National Daily learnt.

Sarri has come in and transformed Chelsea, who are undefeated in 12 games in all competition, and the switch in formation to 4-3-3 has seen Moses lose his place, with the club’s good form hindering opportunities for reserve players.

National Daily gathered that the 27-year-old became a key player under Antonio Conte as a wing-back but now he falls behind Eden Hazard, Willian and Pedro in the reckoning after being moved further up the pitch to play as a winger.

He is just the latest in a group of fringe players who are considering departing the club in January, with Andreas Christensen having recently admitted that he is unhappy with the current level of game time.

However, it is understood that Christensen is impressed by Sarri’s style of play and he would not be let go lightly by the Stamford Bridge hierarchy due to a high transfer valuation.
