Former vice President Atiku Abubakar, presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP,  has picked former Governor Peter Obi of Anambra State, as the PDP vice presidential candidate for the 2019 presidential election scheduled for February 14, 2019.








Atiku’s decision to settle for Obi came after series of speculations and zonal horse trading on who becomes the running mate of the PDP presidential candidate.  Speculators had identified Professor Charles Soludo, Femi Adesina, President of the African Development Bank, Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, as well as Peter |Obi as likely choice of Atiku for the vice president.
The choice of Obi had earlier been revealed even before the PDP national convention in Port Harcourt, Rivers |State but the former Governor denied it. Obi emerged the preferred choice of both the party and the candidate after series of consultations by stakeholders in the party and outside it.
The PDP is set to transmit the names of Atiku and Obi to the Independent National Electoral Commission next week as the party’s presidential and vice presidential candidates for the February 2019 presidential polls. .
