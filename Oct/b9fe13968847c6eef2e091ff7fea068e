The former Senegal boss believes the Reds attacker has the qualities to feature prominently for the best clubs in the world.
Togo coach Claude Le Roy has backed Liverpool star Sadio Mane to fit in straight at either Manchester United, Barcelona or Real Madrid.
The forward has been a hit since his arrival from Southampton in 2016 and he has notched four goals already in eight league games this term.
The Senegal star has formed a formidable strike partnership with Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino in the Reds’ frontline.
“He’s a great player and he’d have his place at Manchester United, at Barcelona, or at Real Madrid,” Le Roy told Stades as per Star Africa.
“It would be a really good thing if I could have him with the [Togo national team].”
Mane has struggled to replicate his club form with Senegal, scoring just a goal in his last nine international outings.
His last goal was against Japan at the 2018 Fifa World Cup in Russia and the experienced gaffer has backed the 26-year-old to rediscover his goalscoring touch for Aliou Cisse’s men who have already booked their place in next year’s Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon.
“Sadio is an excellent player and I tell you that all of Africa watches him play in the Premier League at the weekend as well as the Champions League,” he added.
“However, a club is different to a national team. We often criticise players for not shining so much with the national team, but at the clubs, players know each other.
“All the time, the players see each other training together, whereas in the national team, they only see each other periodically.”
Ahead of Wednesday’s Uefa Champions League game against Red Star Belgrade, Jurgen Klopp confirmed the return of Mane to full training after missing their 1-0 defeat of Huddersfield Town on Saturday due to a hand injury.
