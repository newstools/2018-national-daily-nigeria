after expulsion from the U-17 AFCON

A court in Cotonou (Benin) on Tuesday sentenced the players who had lied about their age and the perpetrators of the case to death after the expulsion of Benin from the U-17 African Cup of Nations.
Cheating that is expensive. Ten players from Benin’s U-17 national team were sentenced on Tuesday to six months’ imprisonment, including one month for rigging their age, while the former president of the Beninese Football Federation, Anjorin Moucharaf, was sentenced to the heaviest sentence, 12 months imprisonment two of which closes.
These sentences follow the exclusion of Squirrel playoffs of the U-17 African Cup of Nations, by the Confederation of African Football.
Up to ten years too
In early September, Benin found itself excluded from the 2019 U-17 Nations Cup, after ten junior players lied about their age with the complicity of several officials of the Federation. The players were really 20 to 27 years old, according to RFI.
The players had been stopped by the police when they got off the plane, returning from Niamey where they had to take part in the qualifications of the U-17 CAN in Tanzania. The new president of the Beninese Football Federation, Mathurin de Chacus, announced that he wanted to “put an end to corruption, improvisation and amateurism” in Beninese football.
