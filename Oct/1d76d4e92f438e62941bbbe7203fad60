President Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday in Abuja declared that Nigeria is prepared to assist South Sudan attain political and economic stability in the African continent.
Playing host to Ezekiel Gatkuoth, Special Envoy of the South Sudanese President who was at State House, Abuja, on courtesy visit on Tuesday, President Buhari acknowledged that Nigeria and South Sudan have a lot in common in the area of developmental aspirations. He remarked: “It has not been smooth sailing for us all the way, too. But since South Sudan wants to share from our experience, we will support where we can, and pray hard for your stability.”
The President advised the leaders of South Sudan to keep making sacrifices “till the environment is completely stabilized,” stressing that stability should always be number one priority.
“You can’t manage a country efficiently till you have first stabilized it. Then, the economy must follow. You must provide jobs for the people, particularly the youths. Also, you need to check corruption. Guide your national resources jealously. We will do our best to support,” Buhari said.
Gatkuoth, who is also his country’s Petroleum Minister, noted that President Buhari is widely admired across the continent for his role in fighting corruption, saying that it was the reason the African Union made him a champion of the anti-corruption crusade in Africa.
He said South Sudan was putting its house in order but needed assistance from Nigeria in the areas of security transformation, constitutional reforms, and infrastructural development.
