The ruling APC has released the list of candidates cleared for the 2019 governorship elections.
The 24-man list was contained in a statement by the party’s National Publicity Secretary Yekini Nabena.
The National Working Committee (NWC) held a meeting on Thursday which led to the release of the list.
