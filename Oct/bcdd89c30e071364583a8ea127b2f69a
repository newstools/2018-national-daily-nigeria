In an interview Ighalo revealed the technique in which he used to convert the winning goal despite many defenders surrounding him.
When asked how he confused the defenders with trickery to slot in through past the Libyan goalkeeper.
He said, “The ball bounced i wanted to shoot at first, but i saw the two defenders i knew they were going to sleep on the ground.

The third goal was the winner but it was also Ighalo who opened the scoring when he converted a ball through to him by captain Ahmed Musa to slot into an empty post.

Ighalo who has been scoring goals in the Chinese Super League (CSL) is expected to join up with the Super Eagles for the next clash against away to South Africa on Saturday, November 17.
