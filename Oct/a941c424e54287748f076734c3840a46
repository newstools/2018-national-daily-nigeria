The organisers of the upcoming Football Africa Forum (FAF) and Awards have announced that Nigerian Football Federation (NFF), President Amaju Pinnick and the executive governor of Plateau State, His excellency Rt Hon  Simon Bako Lalong will both receive recognition for their sterling contributions towards football development at large.
Both recipients will address the FAF on 16 November 2018 and the Awards Ceremony on 17 November 2018 in Johannesburg after the AFCON’19 Qualifier between host country South Africa and Nigeria at the FNB Stadium.
According to Gerrit Davids, organiser of the Forum and Awards, “The Awards are primarily a recognition of the unselfish endeavours of these two personalities and it is testimony that their personal efforts to develop football in their nation and state respectively, has not gone unnoticed.”
The AFA was established in South Africa in November 2017 and Mr Amaju Pinnick, the Nigerian Football Federation (NFF) President, opened the follow-up edition, which took place in Lagos, Nigeria in February 2018.
Davids says, “The major objective of the AFA, as an independent formation, is to serve its affiliates with organisational development through sustainable strategies and to create a home for football structures and other stakeholders, who are not catered for in existing continental structures”.
The launch of the AFA was attended by, among others, the South African Football Players Union, (SAFPU), Footballers Union of Botswana (FUB), South African Football Coaches Association (SAFCA), African Football Institute (AFI), National Association of Nigeria Professional Footballers (NANPF) with speeches delivered by football analyst Emeka Enyadike and a host of other football personalities from across the continent.
