Police authorities in Abuja have denies claims that the officer involved in the unfortunate killing of Anita Akapson is part of the team investigating the unfortunate incident.
Recall that the 31-year-old lady, daughter of ex-Minister of Finance, Nenadi Usman, was shot dead in her 2007 Honda Accord car in Katampe District area of Abuja on October 13, 2018.
In statement released on Monday and made available to National Daily, the PPRO of FCT Command, DSP Anjuguri Manzah, refuted the report by some media that a female police officer involved in the unfortunate killing of Anita Akapson was part of the investigating team.
While expressing the Command’s condolences to the late Anita’s family, Manza reiterated the police commitment at ensuring that the circumstances surrounding Anita death was thoroughly investigated and late Anita Akapson gets justice.
“Suffice it to therefore state that the late Anita Akapson case is currently being investigated by the Team of Homicide experts attached to the FCT Police Command Criminal Intelligence and Investigation Department (CIID).”
He said in compliance with the directive of the Inspector General of Police, the officer involved in the unfortunate incident is still in detention while the Command homicide experts are making progress with the ongoing investigation.
“The Command wants to reassure the general public that police as a revered institution that pride itself in professionalism will continue to be transparent in the investigation of all cases.
Manza therefore advised the press to objective in their reportage of cases under investigation and also ensure that they do not use their medium to mislead members of the public.
He said the suspect will be charged to court when the investigations are concluded.
