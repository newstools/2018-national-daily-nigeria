The National Working Committee, NWC, of the All Progressive Congress, APC, assigned from the National Secretariat, Abuja, to monitor the partyâ€™s governorship primary election in Lagos State has nullified the direct primary election conducted across the 20 local government areas of the state on Tuesday.
The Chairman of the Election Committee, Clement Ebri, addressing the media at about 4.30pm at Protea Hotel, Alausa, said the election could not have held because the committee was still expecting the list of representatives of one of the two aspirants.
Chief Clement Ebri, Chairman of the Lagos State Governorship Primary Election Panel, had earlier declared that accreditation and voting in the primary election had not commenced across the 20 local governments in the state.
The Election Committee Chairman insisted that distribution of electoral materials was to commence at 1.00pm, then, followed by accreditation and voting which will be conducted by the APC NWC appointed officials, in order to ensure a free, fair and credible primary.
The NWC thereafter admonished Lagosians and APC members to disregard reports and footages of ongoing elections in some wards in the State, insisting that no State party official is authorized to accredit or conduct the Lagos Governroship Primary Election.
