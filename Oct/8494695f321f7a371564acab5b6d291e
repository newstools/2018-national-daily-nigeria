The Afenifere has announced the suspension of its member and Social Democratic Party guber candidate in the last governorship election in Osun State .
Iyiola Omisore bagged a year suspension for supporting the APC in the run-off that produced the winner in the tightly contested election which the PDP earlier won by a neck: just over 300 votes.
Against the will of the pan-Yoruba group, Omisore aligned with the APC to win the run-off election in the Ife South and North Local Government Areas of Osun State.
But the former senator has responded.
“I’m yet to be informed on the so-called Afenifere’s suspension, which as far as I’m concerned bypassed the principle of fair hearing.”
According to him, the Osun election was local, and the state chapter of the party approved of his joining forces with the APC.
“The Afenifere’s action is at variance to the reality on the ground as far as the party politics in Osun State is concerned,” he said in statement on Tuesday.
“I’m unaware of the pan-Yoruba group’s directives because we also have bonafide, notable and active APC members in Afenifere.
He insisted that though he’s a member of the Afenifere, the SDP members in Osun State are not necessarily members of Afenifere.
The Afenifere decision was taken at the monthly meeting of the Afenifere, held at the residence of its leader, Chief Reuben Fasoranti, in Akure, the Ondo State capital.
