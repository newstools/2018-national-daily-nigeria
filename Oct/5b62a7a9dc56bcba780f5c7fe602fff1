A group known as the Arewa Youth Consultative Forum (AYCF) has called on Nigerians to vote out President Muhammadu Buhari in 2019 because his administration has failed to meet the yearnings of Nigerians.
In a statement made available to National Daily, President of the group, Yerima Shettima, said the group is endorsing the Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar for President.
He said Atiku’s emergence is a good sign, adding that President Buhari’s administration has failed Nigerians.
He said “For us in AYCF, we have said it over and over that Buhari’s administration has failed Nigerians and we have passed vote of no confidence on the current administration before now, and to that effect we can’t trust this administration anymore.
We are saying that we demand a total new order and for us, the emergence of Atiku is a good thing for Nigeria and we have to look towards that direction.
“I will canvass other ethnic nationalities and groups to ensure that the tenure of this administration comes to an end.
“We will ensure that Buhari’s administration does not exceed beyond 2019, we will vote them out.”
AYCF had earlier called on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to disqualify President Buhari from the 2019 presidential election if he does not present his West African Examinations Council (WAEC) certificate.
The group’s President said this following reports that Buhari failed to submit his credentials to the electoral body recently.
Meanwhile, Dr Kayode Ajulo, an Abuja based Legal Luminary has said that the President can contest in 2019 with primary six certificate.
