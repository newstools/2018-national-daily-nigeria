Juventus have appealed the decision for part of their stadium to be closed for racist chanting.
FIGC observers reported racist chanting was aimed at Napoli centre-back Kalidou Koulibaly during Juve’s 3-1 win against the Partenopei on September 29.
That led to the closure of the Allianz Stadium’s Curva Sud for one match, but ANSA reports the Bianconeri will contest the punishment.
