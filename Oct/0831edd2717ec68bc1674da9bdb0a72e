The cook, a native of Benin. was brought from Ondo.
Not much was known about him. But his pictures found after hos escape indicated he might have been an ex-service man. He was said to be in military fatigues amongst soldiers in the Benin armed forces.
“If you see the knife, it’s a very strong, long and sharp knife that could only be authorised for military personnel,” a source in the police homicide department was quoted as saying.
“After committing the act, the guy went to the toilet and pulled off the white uniform meant for cooks he was wearing because it was all stained with blood.”
Sunday was said to have grabbed as many things as he could—phones, cash, jewelry–before he fled.
The security guard who was also recently employed fled the scene when he discovered his boss had been murdered.
The Ikoyi division of the state police command says it will issue a statement when investigation is over.
