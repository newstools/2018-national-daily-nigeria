Ahead of the opening match of the 2018 FCT Football League billed to kick off tomorrow, Chairman of the FCT Football Association, Musa Talle has stated that the Area 3 football field which will host all the matches will be given a facelift.
The chairman, who was responding to a question over the weekend on what the FA is doing to provide fans stand in the pitch, said that the FA has been making efforts to mordenise the stadium adding that what the FA did in the stadium last year needed to be consolidated.
Mr Talle who spoke at the inauguration of Fosla Football Club over the weekend, said with the entrance of the Karshi-based club in the FCT League, the Federal Capital Territory is in a better position to have two clubs playing in the Nigeria Professional Football League in the next few years.
“Sometimes last year, the field was not as it is now. We put in effort to make sure that we gave it a facelift. This time around, we are going to do something by the special grace of God. We are preparing towards it. Before the FCT league starts, you will see something different in the stadium.
“Our effort is to see that we have a premier league in the FCT. With Fosla Football Club coming on board, I think in the next 3 to 4 years, FCT will have 2 to 3 premier league clubs by the grace of God,” he concluded
