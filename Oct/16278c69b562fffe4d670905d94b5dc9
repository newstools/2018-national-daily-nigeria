Usain Bolt has been told to add some skill to his lightning speed to win a place in the Jamaica national team.

National Daily learnt that the retired sprinter – who holds the world-record at 100m and 200m and a eight-time Olympic gold medalist – has been trying to launch a football career.

Reports suggest he has priced himself out of a modest contract offer from Australian club Central Coast Mariners, despite scoring twice in a recent friendly for the A-League outfit.

He has had his fair share of critics, however, with Perth Glory striker Andy Keogh recently slamming the 32-year-old for having a “touch like a trampoline”.

National Daily  gathered that Jamaican FA President Michael Ricketts believes the national hero could be an asset to his country – if he can develop some footballing finesse.

“If he can add a little bit of skill, some flair, he could supplement this Jamaican team. The players would certainly welcome someone like Usain. I have had informal discussions with some of them and they are excited at the prospect of playing with Usain.
