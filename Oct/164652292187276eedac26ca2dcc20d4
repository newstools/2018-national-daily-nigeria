Belgium has elected a black mayor for the first time – the father of international football star Vincent Kompany.
Pierre Kompany topped the poll for the municipality of Ganshoren in Brussels, earning him the title of mayor.
Mr Kompany arrived in Belgium in 1975 as a refugee from what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo.
He became active in politics in 2006 as a councillor, and took a seat in the Brussels regional parliament in 2014.
But he is perhaps best known for his famous sons. Vincent Kompany is both the captain of English Premier League club Manchester City and a constant fixture on the Belgium national team.
Vincent’s brother, Francois, plays for Belgian side KSV Roeselare.
Both brothers were quick to congratulate their father in an Instagram post shared with Vincent’s 1.6 million followers.
