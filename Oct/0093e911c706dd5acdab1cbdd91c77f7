Jose Mourinho took another thinly-veiled shot at the Manchester United board by comparing the club’s success and amibition with that of Juventus.

The Portuguese’s side met up with the Italian champions in the Champions League this week, with Paulo Dybala’s finish leading Juventus to victory in a match that wasn’t every truly a close contest.

Mourinho has repeatedly said that his team are not strong enough to compete amongst the elite and, following the Champions League defeat, he reiterated the point.

“I am not going to discuss with you the way that I think Manchester United should be organised,” Mourinho said.

“One thing is to compliment Juventus, but it’s another to give my opinion on how Manchester United should or shouldn’t be organised at that level.

“But for me, the biggest compliment to Juventus is not even about their structure.

“My compliment is about the philosophy and the basic things behind the philosophy.

“In the tunnel, before the game, I was speaking with (Juventus chairman Andrea Agnelli) and I was telling him ‘since I left Inter, you have seven titles in a row and it looks like the eighth is coming.’

“And he told me: ‘I don’t want the eighth. I want 10 in a row.’ I think that’s a fantastic answer and a fantastic statement.
