Real Madrid striker Karim Benzema has denied reports he was involved in an attempted kidnapping in Paris, saying people should “give me a break”.

French publication Mediapart claimed Benzema, 30, was involved in the alleged kidnap attempt of an acquaintance who reportedly owes him 50,000 euros (£43,979).

The man allegedly said Benzema and others tried to load him into a black van on 7 October.

According to the report, the man told police he had seen Benzema in the back of the van.
