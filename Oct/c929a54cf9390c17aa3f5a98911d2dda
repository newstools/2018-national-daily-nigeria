Jose Mourinho used Inter’s Treble to tease Juventus fans and insisted Manchester United could’ve had a result with more options off the bench.
Paulo Dybala got the only goal of the game after a first half with almost 70 per cent possession for the visitors, but Paul Pogba hit the post late on.
“I think with the way we ended the game for the last 20 minutes, it would’ve been very different if we had Marouane Fellaini or Alexis Sanchez to take off the bench,” Mourinho told Sky Sport Italia.
“We had a super-difficult game just two days ago. In any case, Juve have a great deal of quality. We did what we possibly could with heart and in my opinion a positive approach.
“We knew when the draw was made that we’d be fighting Valencia for second place in the group.”
There was tension in the final minutes, as some of the 4,000 Juve fans were insulting Mourinho, so he responded by holding up three fingers to represent Inter’s 2010 Treble – something Juventus have never achieved.
“It’s an obvious response. Obviously, they don’t love me. Obviously, the toughest moment for them was our Treble. That’s fine. With players, Coaches, club and everything, we have total respect, everything is very cordial.”
