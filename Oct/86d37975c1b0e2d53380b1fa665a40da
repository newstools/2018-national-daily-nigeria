China-based striker Odion Ighalo has helped Nigeria’s Super Eagles to make progress in its AFCON qualifier against Libya in Uyo .
The Match hero Ighalo  scored three goals to assist Eagles within qualifying range of the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations as they moved from the third position on the log to the second position
Coach Gernot Rohr said that Ighalo is ahead of Watford front man Isaac Success in the Super Eagles, because he has formed a better understanding with the rest of the team, having been part of the team for much longer.
The Eagles coach also argued that Ighalo has regained his form after a difficult World Cup campaign.
“He had a World Cup which was not so easy for him,” he said. “But he’s doing well with his club, he has more than 20 goals.”
