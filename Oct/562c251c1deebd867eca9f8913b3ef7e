Another video trending on social media showing Kano Governor Abdullahi Ganduje, in black Kaftan, collecting money from a contractor, has added a new dimension to the bribery scandal rocking the APC governor.
But the editor-In-chief of the Daily Nigerian who broke the scandal weeks ago has denied releasing the latest video.
Jaafar Jaafar, according to PRNigeria, has submitted all the clips with to the state assembly probing the incident.
“I swore an oath with the Holy Quaran before tendering the several videos at the Kano State Assembly and I could not have been responsible for the current video trending on social media. Therefore Daily Nigerian did not release any other video after the appearance before lawmakers,” Mr Jaafar said.
Before the appearance of the publisher at the Kano State House Assembly, Daily Nigerian had published two videos showing the governor receiving bundles of dollars and putting them into his white dress known as ‘babanriga’ in the northern part of Nigeria.
The latest trending video shows Mr Ganduje allegedly receiving kickback from contractors, speaking audibly on those who have paid and others outstanding.
The unedited trending videos exposed the names of contractors, projects and the voice of the purported bribe giver. It also has the translation in English with dates and timelines. This time around Governor Ganduje appeared in Black Kaftan with his clear voice and that of the bribe giver.
Unlike the previous videos officially released by Daily Nigerian, the latest trending videos are suspected to have been released by other parties who could have had access to them after copies were released to security agencies and Kano State House of Assembly.
