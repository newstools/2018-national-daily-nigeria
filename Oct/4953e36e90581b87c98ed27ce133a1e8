Peoples Democratic Party’s flagbearer Atiku Abubakar has again commented on his endorsement by former President Olusegun Obasanjo in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital on Thursday.
In a speech delivered after series of meeting, Mr Obasanjo has openly endorsed his erstwhile deputy for the February 2019 presidential election.
He spoke when Mr Abubakar and leaders of the Peoples Democratic Party visited him at his Abeokuta home.
The former president said he believed Mr Abubakar had ‘re-discovered and re-positioned himself’ and is now good enough to enjoy his support in the next election.
Speaking at a meeting with members of the PDP Board of Trustees (BoT) on Thursday night in Abuja, Mr Abubakar said though he could not confirm if Mr Obasanjo had returned to the party, he was sure that the former president was now with him “body and spirit.”
The PDP presidential candidate, who describe the meeting “as a successful outing,” revealed what transpired between him and Mr Obasanjo moments before he (Mr Obasanjo) openly endorsed him.
“I may not say whether he is a PDP member or not, but he is with us body and spirit.
“Even before he delivered his statement, we retired to his private room where he gave me his statement to go through and possibly edit.
“He said he would launch my campaign to the presidency with a statement. That is vintage Olusegun Obasanjo for you,” Mr Abubakar said.
The presidential candidate thanked the party leaders and members for his emergence as PDP’s flagbearer, urging them to gird their loins for the election proper.
