A team of Nigerian doctors on Tuesday successfully separated a set of conjoined twins at the University of Abuja Teaching Hospital, Gwagwalada.
This is as the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon Yakubu Dogara paid the bill for the process leading to the separation of the conjoined twins.
The doctors led by Dr. Nuhu Kwajafa of the Global Peace Initiatives confirmed the success of the operation that took them many hours in a post on his Instagram account @nuhukwaj.
“We wish to express our profound gratitude, as we say a massive thank you to Rt Hon Yakubu Dogara, for his kind hearted and extremely generous gesture to the successfully separated twins and their family…God bless you Sir”, Dr Kwajafa posted.
