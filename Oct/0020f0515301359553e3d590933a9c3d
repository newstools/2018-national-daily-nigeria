Barcelona midfielder Ivan Rakitic has suggested that Real Madrid made it too easy for the Catalan giants to win El Clasico on Sunday.
Both teams are yet to hit to gear this season, but a hat-trick from Luis Suarez helped Barca run out 5-1 victors at Camp Nou.
Real – who are likely to sack manager Julen Lopetegui this week – had got back into the game at 2-1, but Rakitic has suggested that the European champions ‘were not clever’ when attempting to find an equaliser.
The Croatian is quoted by Marca as saying: “Madrid were not very clever when they had the opportunity to equalise. We were able to get lots of bodies in the box and fight to make sure we stayed in front, then we were in a position to react.
“We played a great match from the first minute to the last, we were totally superior in the result and in the performance. The third goal helped us a lot because when that went in it gave us peace of mind and allowed us to play naturally again.”
Jordi Alba’s solemn pass was met by Coutinho who coolly slotted it past Thibaut and the Real madrid’s Captain Ramos to give Barca the lead. Suarez grabbed an hatrick to his name and was capped with a Vida’s three minute free header as a substitute for Authur.
Barca now sit seven points ahead of Real in the top-flight standings.
