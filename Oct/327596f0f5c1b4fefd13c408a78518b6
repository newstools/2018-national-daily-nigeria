Henry Abiodun has announced his departure from Sunshine Stars after ending his six-year union with the Ondo State Football Agency.

Abiodun has been the interim coach of the side since the dismissal of erstwhile manager Duke Udi during the 2018 season.

National Daily learnt that the tactician joined the Ondo State outfit in November 2012 as a technical instructor and has served in several roles, including as coach of Sunshine Stars and technical director of both the team and ODSFA.

His current contract ends in December but he chose to part ways with the Nigeria Professional Football League outfit with two months left on his deal.

According to the 50-year-old, the decision came in light of the agency’s abrupt dissolution of the players, coaches and backroom staff.

“After due consideration, I decided to bow out from the Ondo State football Agency job as Sunshine Stars and the agency’s technical director,” Abiodun told Goal.


“My contract ends in December but after the dissolution of the players, coaches and backroom staff, it only makes sense that I move forward.


“I am now a free agent at least for now. I have made my decision known to the chairman recently. I now wait for my entitlements to be aid as quickly as possible.”
