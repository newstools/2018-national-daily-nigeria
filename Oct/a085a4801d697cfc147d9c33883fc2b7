Kaduna Central Senator Shehu Sani has resigned his membership of the All Progressives Congress.
He stated this in a letter dated October 19 and addressed to the chairman of APC, Adams Oshiomhole.
The senator gave no reasons for his decision, but it might not be unconnected with his perennial feud with Kaduna Gov Nasir el-Rufai, which cost the senator a return ticket in the APC.
” I present to you highest compliments and wish by this communication to formally offer to you my resignation from the All Progressives Congress (APC).
“I had joined the APC and remained with it against all odds with the belief that it will constitute a veritable platform for the realization of those democratic ideals which I hold very dear, that honour and integrity will be the ultimate ethos of the party and, most importantly, that internal party democracy will always be the norm. However, only posterity can affirm the extent to which the APC has committed to and reflected these values.
“As I exit the APC at this point in time, I wish to formally thank the party for availing me the platform upon which I am currently serving this country in the honoured capacity of Senator of the Federal Republic.
“I wish the party well in all her future endeavours and ask, Sir, that you please accept the assurance of my highest considerations.”
