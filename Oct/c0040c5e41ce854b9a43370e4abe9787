Lewis Hamilton, the 2018 Formula One World Champion finishes a struggling 4th, but at the end of the day manages to nail the bigger result and brings an end to the title tussle between him and Sebastian Vettel. This is Hamilton’s 5th World Championship Title and his dreams of chasing the record by Michael Schumacher seems to be shaping up quite well.
National Daily learnt that Max Verstappen wins the Mexican GP for the second time in a row with a dominating run right from the start. Vettel finishes 2nd, which is his first ever podium finish in Mexico with Kimi also on the podium with a 3rd place finish.
“Amazing,” said Verstappen as David Coulthard interviewed him. “I didn’t sleep very well last night, I was very determined to win, and we’ve done that. We had the right tyres and the car was working very well.” He further said there’ll be no big winner’s party tonight: “I’m going home”.
Red Bull would be really disappointed with the overtly questioned reliability of the Renault engines, to which Ricciardo fell prey and had his 8th non-finish today.
For Hamilton, it’s a result with a solid performance by both Hamilton and Mercedes throughout this season with little to no errors. Ferrari, on the other hand took a lot of faulty decisions which, in combination with consistent errors by Vettel himself has cost him the 2018 title.
