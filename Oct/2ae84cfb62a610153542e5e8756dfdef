Marcelo gave his face in mixed zone after the victory of Madrid , victory that did not end with the doubts of the team. The Brazilian left a message to the journalists.
The change : “Now I feel good, I had a hard blow, that kind of tickets can not be given, the referees have to see those things”.
Lopetegui : “I’m fine, I’m fine, Lopetegui at the Camp Nou, wonderful, he’s doing a great job for me.”
Criticism : “It’s hard when you do not win but you talk about crisis that you try to hurt this wardrobe, all journalists try to hurt, like envy because you can not play football.”
The goal : “I’ve dedicated it to Pintus because I like it and he does not have hair and I do.”
Leave Madrid? : “I have not heard any offer, there is no one more Madridista than me”.
