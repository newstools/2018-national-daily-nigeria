FIFA chief Gianni Infantino is likely to face questions over his relationship with Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman.

Earlier this year, a consortium lead by Japan’s SoftBank, and backed by Saudi cash, wanted to invest $25bn over 12 years in the two competitions.

The revised format for the Club World Cup was outlined in May and would see the contest held every four years. It’s believed 12 top European teams would be among the global participants. Manchester United and Liverpool are thought to be amongst the sides that Fifa wants to see take part in the inaugural competition in 2021.

FIFA president Gianni Infantino is likely to face questions at the meeting over his relationship with Saudi’s Crown Prince, Mohammed Bin Salman, in light of the country’s recent admission over Khashoggi.

Infantino has met senior Saudi officials four times in the past year – including one trip to open the Saudi Football Association’s new website.
