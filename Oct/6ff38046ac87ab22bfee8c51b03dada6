All is set for Femi Otedola, son of Chief Michael Otedola of the defunct National Republican Convention, NRC, of 1993, to battle former governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, in 2015, Jimi Agbaje, for the party’s governorship ticket for 2019 election in Lagos State. Jimi Agbaje lost the 2015 governorship election to incumbent Governor Akinwumi    Ambode of the All Progressives Congress, APC, who is currently battling for survival and struggling for the APC ticket for a second term. Many Lagosians consider Otedola a reliable alternative to the lingering quagmire in the APC over the resolve of APC leader, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, to stop Ambode and replace him with Babajide Sanwaolu.
Several APC members had expected Otedola to contest the governorship ticket of the ruling party; they were prepared to support him even against Ambode but he opted for PDP. Jimi Agbaje will have a tough battle to fight with Femi Otedola for the PDP ticket for 2019. This is one man many people in Lagos State are waiting for.
