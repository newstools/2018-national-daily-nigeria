Ekiti’s former former governor, Ayodele Fayose, has been let out of the Ikoyi prison about two weeks after he was detained by the EFCC, and arraigned on corruption charges last Wednesday.
He remained in detention until he was able to meet the terms of his bail conditions—N50 million with two sureties in like sum.
According to his spokesman, Lere Olayinka, who shared the news on his Twitter handle, Fayose left the Federal High Court, Ikoyi a few minutes ago.
“We will meet @officialEFCC at the court from November 19. Thank you Nigerians.”
Justice Mojisola Olatoregun ordered that the former governor be remanded in prison custody until he fulfilled the terms of his bail.
Fayose is facing N2.2bn fraud charges, brought against him by the EFCC in the wide-ranging arms vote mismanagement known as Dasukigate.
