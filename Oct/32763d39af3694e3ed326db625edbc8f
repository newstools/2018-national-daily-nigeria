￼Super Eagles Striker, Isaac Success breaks the jinx after playing for two years without a goal in the Premier League ,when he move from Granada to Watford.
The long goal drought, however, ended on Saturday for the 22-yeard old forward as he scored the last goal as Watford saw off Huddersfield Town 3-0.
Although he has recorded two goals in cup games for the Hornets since joining from Granada in a record deal as a highly rated prospect in the summer of 2016, the striker has yet to find the back of the net in the top-flight.

But on Saturday afternoon, with his side already two goals ahead, the Nigeria international wrap up the victory, finishing off a perfect free kick move with ten minutes left of regular time.
His persistence with the tactic yielded dividends again as Roberto Pereyra and Gerard Deulofeu both converted solo efforts to put them two-goal ahead within nine first-half minutes before Success’ late effort – on his 29th Premier League outing – to make the maximum points safe.
￼The 22-year-old has now scored three goals in 12 games across all competitions for seventh-placed Watford.
