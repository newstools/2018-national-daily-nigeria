Buhari said this while hosting some entertainers and members of Kannywood to a dinner at the Presidential Villa, Abuja on Thursday evening.
Speaking Hausa language, the president he would continue to hold Jonathan in high esteem because of that decision.
“He was in power as deputy governor, Governor (Bayelsa), Vice-President and President, all for about 10 years and he voluntarily accepted defeat and surrendered power to me,” said Buhari.
He urged the entertainers to continue to use their talents to promote the culture of peaceful co-existence and unity in the country.
SGF Boss Mustapha said the fans of the entertainers would guarantee Buhari at least five million votes in the 2019 presidential election.
He urged them to use their platforms in the social media in promoting the achievements of the Buhari administration.
Representatives of the Kannywood entertainers, who spoke at the event, promised to mobilise support for Buhari and other APC candidates in the forthcoming elections.
