As far as football coaching is concerned in Nigeria, the name of Samson Unuanel  told National Daily that is not a pushover considering his achievements and ways of discovering talents from the grassroots.

Players like Dare Ojo, Samuel Adegbenro, Stanley Dimgba, Isiaka Oladuntoye, Yaya Adamu,  Evans Iyoro,Ganiyu Oseni,  Dele Ajiboye and others  would never forget how their careers were helped by Samson Unuanel.

Unuanel took Dare Ojo and Samuel Adegbenro from the streets of Osogbo, and today, Dare is playing in CAF competition for Enyimba, while Samuel had played in the Europa League and he is doing well in Europe.

Unuanel left Kwara United last four seasons and was replaced with Tunde Abdulrahman who was unable to change the fortune of the club.

Kwara fans are celebrating the promotion of their feeders team to the NNL, but many did not know that it was Samson Unuanel that steered the team to the National League.

Some are wondering the rationale that made him to accept the job considering his status as a Premier League coach, and Unuanel has given some explanation.

“I came back to Kwara because I want the fans to know that I am not their enemy and that was why I took the challenge to be the coach of the Feeders team for me to make a statement.

“There are lots of talented players in Kwara that will go far in their career if properly managed.
