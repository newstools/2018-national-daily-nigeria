LeBron James has long supported Colin Kaepernick and the movement the former NFL quarterback started by taking a knee in 2016.
James rocked a grey long sleeved shirt with Kaepernick’s name across the back ahead of the Los Angeles Lakers’ preseason game against the Sacramento Kings at the Staples Center on Thursday night.
The 33-year-old pledged his support to Kaepernick last month when his massive Nike campaign was released, too, and Thursday’s showing is yet even more proof that he meant it.
