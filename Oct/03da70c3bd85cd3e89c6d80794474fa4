Barcelona are planning to extend Lionel Messi’s contract to 2022, according to Spanish outlet Mundo Deportivo.

Last November, the Barcelona superstar has just signed contract extension with the club, which would see him stay at Camp Nou until 2021.

However, the La Liga giants are now preparing to offer him a new deal until 2022.

There is a special clause in Messi’s current deal that could see him leave Barcelona in advance should he go to a club which is not a powerhouse in Europe.

That is to say, Messi can go return to his boyhood club Newells Old Boys back in Argentina if he wants.

Despite his age, the 31-year-old has continued to prove his importance for Barcelona in the new season.

His buyout clause is now set at €700m.
