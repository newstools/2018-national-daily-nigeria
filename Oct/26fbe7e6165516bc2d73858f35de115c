Packaged ice is the kind one picks up in the grocery store, the convenience store or mass market store on the way to the good times. Packaged ice may be shaved, cubed, nuggeted, or crushed.  It may be made from tap water, spring water, or purified water.  But no matter what the shape or the source, ice is considered a food by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). If it is made in one state and sold In another, packaged ice is regulated, as a food. FDA rules require that packaged ice must be produced with properly cleaned and maintained equipment from water that is safe and sanitary and that it is stored and transported in clean and sanitary conditions.

This seemingly innocent product can carry salmonella, E. coli, and many other dangerous things if it hasn’t been produced and stored properly. And this can lead to a number of illnesses, especially in the very young or very old, or those who already have a comprised immune system.

According to the National Center for Disease Control, “ice may become contaminated from the use of impure water, contamination of ice making machines, or from improper storage or handling of ice.”

Since freezing does not kill bacteria or viruses, it is imperative that the ice one uses in their drinks or near their food, be safe.

The Dangers in Packaged Ice
 
According to the International Packaged Ice Association, Americans eat more ice than bread. And 80% of the packaged ice is bought between Memorial Day and Labor Day. And there is very little, if any, inspection or government oversight of all packaged ice producers in this country. The International Packaged ice Association has set standards for ice safety. It’s a non-profit association that represents ice producers. The Association has some tips to help keep you and your family safe.

– Make sure the ice package is sealed properly.

– Drawstring ties are not a good seal for this product.

– Ice from outside vending machines may not be safe.

– The ice should be “clear, odorless and tasteless”.

– Check the ice before consuming for foreign objects or particles.

-Make sure the bag has the manufacturer’s name, address, and phone number.

– Avoid cross-contamination. If ice touches raw meat, it can become contaminated and can spread bacteria to other foods.
