Former Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger will return to the dugout to manage a World XI side in Per Mertesacker’s farewell match, according to a report on the Daily Mail.

Wenger’s World XI team will go up against ‘Mertesacker’s Hannover 96 friends’ in Hannover.

The Frenchman has not yet secured a new job since his departure from the Gunners at the end of last season but is close with Mertesacker and has agreed to help his former player out.

Wenger has experienced matches like these before, as he helped Nwankwo Kanu in his farewell match at Barnet’s Hive stadium.

Wenger’s World XI team is expected to have players like Miroslav Klose and Claudio Pizzaro.

Former Arsenal winger Theo Walcott is set to play for Mertesacker’s team in what will be an emotional event for the German.
