The Lagos State House of Assembly Speaker Rt. Hon. Mudashiru Obasa,has officially declared that the state legislature does not have any intention to impeach Governor Akinwunmi Ambode anytime soon,affirming that impeachment process cannot be shrouded in secrecy as peddled about by rumour mongers.
Obasa made the clarification at the beginning of plenary today, citing the barrage of calls and enquiries of stakeholders and distinguished personalities in the state on the rumoured commencement of impeachment process against Governor Ambode, as a prompt for him to clear the air on the matter.
According to him, Solidarity Group of Nigeria and a faction of the APC in Lagos State, led by Mr. Fuad Oki had been peddling the rumour that the lawmakers in the state threatened Governor Ambode to open the state treasury for them, and that they threatened to impeach him if he failed to do so.
“To put the record straight,there is nothing of such for now, if need be at all, the Governor will be the one to direct us by his actions and inactions.
“Impeachment process is constitutional,it is a function of the Assembly, it is not an offence and not against the rule of law,the wailers can’t stop us if need be, we are only answerable to the people.
“We don’t need the wailers to guide us in performing our duties.
“Impeachment has a process and when we start everybody will know,but for now we are working with our Governor for the progress of Lagos state.” Obasa reiterates.
This was corroborated by the Majority Leader of the House, Hon. Sanai Agunbiade, who stated that the constitutional procedure for impeachment does not harbour secrecy, adding that members of the public would know if such would happen.
