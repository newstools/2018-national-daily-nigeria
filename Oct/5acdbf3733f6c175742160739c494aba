Super Eagles head coach ,Gernot Rohr revealed that he didn’t see a player who could make his team either Enugu Rangers or Kano Pillars during  the AITEO Cup final recently.
Rohr told National Daily that there is still more work to be done on the pitch of the Stephen Keshi Stadium in Asaba, if it was to host a Super Eagles game.
Rangers staged a stunning comeback to beat Pillars 4- 2 on penalties Wednesday in Asaba with Rohr watching from the stands .
“ I am satisfied with the match, but I didn ’ t really see one player better than the players I have, ” Rohr told National Daily .
“ Stephen Keshi stadium  is not really good for Super Eagles games . ”
“ It showed that in football it is never finished until after the final whistle . You have to fight to win the game.
“ But I would have wanted extra- time. The match going into penalties immediately was cruel especially for the team who were losing. ”
