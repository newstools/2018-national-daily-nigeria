Ali Billikisu bags the Soccer queen referee of  the NWPL week eleven and be rewarded with a cash prize of N25,000 proudly sponsored by NFF First Vice President Barrister Seyi Akinwunmi .

The week 11 encounter of the Nigeria Women Premier League had so many difficult officiating across various centres in the country but Bilikisu Ali from the Kwara State Referee Council emerged the Soccer Queens NWPL Referee of the week.

The Ilorin-born referee officiated the highly tensed game between two South-South rivals Ibom Angels and Bayelsa Queens, a game which ended 1-0 in favour of the home team.

Despite officiating in a very tight and highly rated game which of course came with a lot of pressure from the home fans, who are visibly desperate to see their side qualify for the Super 4 Championship, Billikisu was firm all through the game, making less cases for errors and was also said to be fair in her officiating all through the pulsating game.

The weekly award which is proudly  sponsored by Mr. Akinwunmi is aimed at honoring women referees who have a strong work ethic, have knowledge of the rules of the game and are positive role models and will see the winner going home with N25,000 cash prize.

A team of women football experts and panelist voted based on reports gathered by assessors all around various match centres.
