The Boston Red Sox won their fourth World Series championship in 15 years, beating the Los Angeles Dodgers 5-1 in Game 5 Sunday night behind David Price’s pitching and Steve Pearce’s power.
National Daily learnt that Alex Cora became the first manager from Puerto Rico to guide a team to the title. He’s just the fifth rookie skipper to do it overall.
After posting a team-record 108 wins in the regular season and romping through the AL playoffs, the Red Sox finished off a one-sided Series.
Price threw three-hit ball into the eighth inning. Pearce hit two home runs, a night after his homer and double spurred a late rally.
Mookie Betts and J.D. Martinez also connected as the Red Sox hit three homers off Clayton Kershaw.
Los Angeles lost Game 7 of the World Series last year to Houston, also at Dodger Stadium, by the same 5-1 score.
