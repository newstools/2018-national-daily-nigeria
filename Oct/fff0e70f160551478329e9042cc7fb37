Super Eagles captain Mikel Obi for the third straight time, National Daily noted, has been left out of the  squad causing one to wonder whether the former Chelsea star has quit national team.
No information yet ,but officials are not in a hurry to make this big announcement.
When the Eagles captain was left out of the AFCON double-header against Libya, officials said the team wanted to allow him time to recover from some niggling injuries.
Super Eagles spokesman Toyin Ibitoye  told National Daily that he wiuld go as far as assuring that Mikel will be back for the qualifier in South Africa.
On Sunday, he captained his Chinese Super League club Tianjin Teda and even scored his second goal of the season.
But he is again missing from the Eagles latest selection to provoke more questions like whether he has finally taken his bow from international football, like Victor Moses did soon after the World Cup in Russia.
