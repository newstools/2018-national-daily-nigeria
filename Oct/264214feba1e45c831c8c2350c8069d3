Information and Culture Minister Lai Mohammed has denied the report on social media that Nigeria would send missile to Israel if IPOB’s leader Nnamdi Kanu was not released to Nigeria for the continuation of his prosecution.
He described the report as fake news while briefing State House correspondents after the Federal Executive Council, FEC, meeting presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari, at the Council Chamber, Presidential Villa, Abuja, on Wednesday.
“I was in London when I heard the story about Nnamdi Kanu surfacing in Israel. I was not in a position to make any statement. But before I knew it, within a few hours, I saw my picture with a story saying that I had actually given Israel ultimatum to return Nnamdi Kanu otherwise, we will send them missiles.,’ he said.
“I just laughed. It speaks to what we are talking about fake news because it is probably the biggest threat in the run-up to the elections. .
“But this has proven that all along when Kanu disappeared and the mob was asking the Nigerian army to account for the whereabouts of Kanu; I kept saying that Kanu knows where he is.
i The minister noted at the appropriate time, the various authorities will make a statement about the issue of Kanu
