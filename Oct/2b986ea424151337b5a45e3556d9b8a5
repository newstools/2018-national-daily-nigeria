The Nigeria Basketball Federation is to organize a 3-day refresher course for referees in continuation of its capacity building of key stakeholders in basketball.
The event which will hold between October 23rd and 26th will be anchored by two renowned FIBA referees, Kingsley Ojeaburu and Ogunleye Opeyemi in Lagos.
Ojeaburu remains the only Nigerian to have ever officiated at any FIBA World Cup for men after he got nominated in 2014.
He was also on duty at the 2017 FIBA Africa Cup of Nations for men, 2018 Commonwealth Games in Australia as well as the 3rd and 4th windows of the ongoing FIBA World Cup qualifiers for men in Senegal and Tunisia.
Opeyemi (Opra) was on duty during the FIBA U-17 Women’s World Cup in Belarus, 2017 FIBA Africa Cup of Nations for men as well as the Window 4 of the ongoing 2019 FIBA Men’s World Cup qualifiers in Tunisia.
NBBF President, Engr. Musa Kida said it was important for the federation to spread its developmental programs across board.
“We cannot get the best out of our players from our leagues if we don’t have sound referees and coaches. The relationship between coaches, players and referees is symbiotic. So as we are focused on improving our output from the grassroots, we also need to pay special attention to our referees and coaches.”
Kida said the state, Zonal and Conference phases of the Total sponsored National Division 2 was an eye opener on the need for referees to undergo refresher courses to stay abreast of new basketball rules.
To encourage participation, the NBBF has declared the training free for all intending referees who will be attending the training being sponsored by Total Nigeria in conjunction with the NBBF.
For referees outside Lagos, accommodation will be provided at no cost at the hostel of the National Institute for Sports throughout the duration of the training.
