The Sports Writers Association of Nigeria (SWAN), Oyo state Chapter has condemned the unwarranted attacks on the match officials and Chief Coach of Shooting Stars Sports Club, Edith Agoye by some irate officials of Akwa Starlets on Saturday.
After the visiting Oluyole Warriors battled the hosts to a scoreless draw in Uyo, some enraged officials of home team descended on the centre referee and beat him to stupor.
The Chief Coach of the visiting team Edith Agoye was also assaulted, with the gaffer losing consciousness in the process.
Reports had it that it took ten minutes before the coach, who was said to have been hit on the head, was revived.
Chairman Mr Niyi Alebiosu and the Association’s Secretary, Adewale Tijani, Oyo SWAN described the attack on the match officials and the coach of the visiting team as not only unsportsmanly but also barbaric.
“It is sad and appalling that in this modern age when football and other games are being used to promote friendship among peoples of various ethnics and races, some delinquents could still use the beautiful game to perpetuate violence on innocent persons”.
The umbrella body of sports writers in Oyo state said nothing could justify these needless attacks on men who were performing their duties.
Oyo SWAN then called on the governing body of the Nigeria National League (NNL) to fish out the perpetrators of heinous acts and bring them to book.
“The action is necessary to deter other likely culprits from engaging in such vices that are capable of bringing the game of football into disrepute in Nigeria”.
Oyo SWAN also advised NNL to take stringent measures to put an end to this ugly development, which it noted was not good for Nigerian football that is just attracting investments and sponsorships.
