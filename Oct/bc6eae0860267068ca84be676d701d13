Shadrack Asiegbu scored the decisive goal as Abia Warriors defeated Rivers United 1-0 in the AITEO Cup on Friday.
The attacker pounced on 75 minutes following tentative defending by the Rivers United FC rear guard to fire home his side’s winner in the Group C contest decided at the Legacy Pitch of the National Stadium, Lagos.
It marked a disappointing  end to the tournament for the ‘Pride of Rivers’.
United lost all three group games on the Lagos centre.
An opening day 2-3 loss to Kano Pillars was followed by a 0-1 reverse to eventual group winners, Kwara United on match day two.
Technical Manager of Rivers United, Eguma Stanley and his Abia Warriors counterpart, Emmanuel Deutsch spoke to National Daily learnt.
