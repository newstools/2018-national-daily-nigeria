Tony Ojobo, public relations guru and public affairs Ddrector at the Nigerian Communication Commission (NCC), has stepped aside to pursue other interests.
 Ojobo, in a statement, described the media he closely worked with as the harbingers of news and information, stressing, “the media remains a critical stakeholder in the Affairs of the NCC”.
 He highlighted some activities of the Commission, during his time, to include the Mobile Number Portability, Do Not Disturb (DND), Quality of Service issues, Year of Telecom Consumer information drive, and all events and interactive programs in the media.
 “We had some very difficult moments with QoS, unsolicited messages, porting challenges, MTN fine imbroglio and SIM Card Registration issues which are still being frontally addressed by the Commission. All these issues remain work in progress.
 “There is however, light at the end of the tunnel as most of the issues will be addressed by the Commission. It is my hope that you continue to support my successor and the NCC as much as you can,” Ojobo stated.
 “I will continue to network with you and interact on matters affecting the industry and other areas of interest,” he assured.
Speaking on his next line of action as he takes his exit from NCC, he said: “My journey at the Nigerian Communications Commission, a telecommunications regulatory body comes to an end on the 5th of October, 2018.
 “It has been of phenomenal journey that began in March 2000. As I exit the Commission, I would be pursuing other interests, including the completion of his Doctoral program in Entrepreneurship and Leadership with the Walden University, in Minnesota, the United States of America.”
 The Commission is expected to name Ojobo’s successor in the coming days.
