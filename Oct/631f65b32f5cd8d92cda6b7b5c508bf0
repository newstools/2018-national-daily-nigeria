Liverpool have received a potential boost ahead of Saturday’s visit to Huddersfield Town as Mohamed Salah, Virgil van Dijk and James Milner all featured in training on Thursday.

The trio were part of the Reds mounting injury worries that began when Milner came off with a hamstring injury against Manchester City and grew increasingly concerning for the club during the international break.

Salah limped out of Egypt’s first game of the international break against Swaziland with a thigh injury, followed by Van Dijk’s withdrawl from the Netherlands camp to nurse a rib injury after opening the scoring in the Oranje’s 3-0 Nations League win over Germany.

The club released photos of Van Dijk, Salah and Milner taking part in Thursday’s session , indicating they are on the right path.

Van Dijk had been tipped to play by Netherlands manager Ronald Koeman , and there had been reports of Salah’s fitness improving.
