The leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra has revealed how he fled Nigeria as the Nigerian Army clamped down on his group outlawed in the southern part of Nigeria last year.
Contrary to the report that the DSS schlepped him out of the country, Nnamdi Kanu told the Israeli TV Channel 1 he was “smuggled out” of the country by his relatives.
The secessionist leader got bail on medical ground as his treason trial was on-going then.
But he escaped during the Nigerian army’s Operation Python Dance, launched in the south-east.
His latest video showed he was in Israel, though the Israeli authorities denied it.
He said in the interview that 28 persons were killed during the army operation which targeted  his father’s residence in Umuahia, Abia state.
“My people evacuated me before they came to my bedroom. They took me away and smuggled me out of Nigeria. I needed some time to recover which I did and then, had to make my way to Israel,” he said.
He added that he feels “relieved” that he “managed to make it” to Israel, “the only place I feel safe in the world.”
He had been living in England running a pirate station called Radio Biafra—before he decoded to come and move the Igbo to secede.
“ I still don’t feel safe in England. That is why I stayed back in Israel.”
Senator Eyniaya Abaribe, who was one of his sureties, is now under pressure ti produce the suspect he guaranteed.
