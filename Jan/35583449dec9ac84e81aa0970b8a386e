Chelsea manager, Antonio Conte has lambasted the club for refusing to grant him his request to sign some certain players into the club.

The former Juventus manager said he usually ends up in clubs running an austerity programme, which Chelsea is one of such clubs.

Conte said he does not aim high with his transfer requests but “rarely been given the players I asked for.”

The Italian spoke after he was questioned about his January plans after the Wednesday’s 2-2 draw with Arsenal at the Emirate Stadium.

The Blues played out a thrilling 2-2 draw at London rivals Arsenal in the Premier League on Wednesday, but the attention soon turned to the transfer window and possible signings.

The West London outfit has been linked with Bayern Munich midfielder, Arturo Vidal while Monaco’s Thomas Lemar has also been mentioned.

However, Conte told Sky Sport Italia, “I do not aim high with my requests, especially as in my history I’ve rarely been given the players I asked for.

“I always ended up at clubs who were running an austerity programme.

“I just try to do my work. If someone arrives, good, if they don’t, then that’s fine too. I have to continue my work, either way.”
