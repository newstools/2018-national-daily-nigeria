Super Eagles and Leicester City midfielder, Wilfred Ndidi is the player with the most successful tackles across the top five leagues in Europe, according to Squawka Football.
The football news and statistics website revealed that Ndidi has made 91 successful tackles this season, more than any player in the Premier League, the Bundesliga, Serie A, La Liga and Ligue 1.
“Wilfred Ndidi has made more successful tackles (91) than any other player in Europe’s top 5 Leagues this season. 18 more than the next,” the website wrote on their Twitter handle.
Ndidi, 21, joined the Foxes in January 2017 from Belgian side, Genk FC, and has contributed to the fairly improved form of the former English champions.
Like Kasper Schmeichel, Wes Morgan, Riyad Mahrez, Marc Albrighton, and Harry Maguire, the Nigeria international has played in all 22 Premier League games for Leicester so far this season.
Leicester sit on eighth spot in the league table, and will play Fleetwood in FA Cup on Saturday.
