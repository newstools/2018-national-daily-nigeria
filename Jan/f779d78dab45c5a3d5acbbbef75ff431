Coming barely weeks after Father Mbaka of Adoration ministries, Enugu State cautioned President Muhammadu Buhari over his 2019 second term bid, Olubunmi Okogie, archbishop emeritus of the Catholic archdiocese of Lagos, has also advised Buhari to respect himself and retire quietly.
Speaking in Lagos, Okogie said it is an insult to Nigerians for the president to be talking about 2019 election. The archbishop advised Buhari to be thinking of finding solutions to the problems confronting Nigerians.
“What has he done in the years he had been in the saddle? He has performed woefully; that’s the verdict of Nigerians,” Okogie said.
“Let the president respect himself and retire quietly. Coming out to talk of 2019 is insulting not only to those who voted him to power but to all Nigerians.
“There are so many problems confronting the people and he should be thinking of what to do about them. For second term, he must be a joker.
“That is all I can say for now because I don’t want to dignify them with a lengthy statement. It is not worth it.”
Although Buhari has not spoken publicly about his decision on the next election, there are indications that the president intends to stay in office beyond 2019.
On Wednesday Adebayo Shittu, minister of communications, said the campaign for the re-election of Buhari had commenced. He also disclosed that the south-west campaign offices would be inaugurated on January 20.
Shittu spoke after meeting with the president.
There are reports that Rotimi Amaechi, minister of transportation, has been appointed as the director-general of Buhari campaign.
