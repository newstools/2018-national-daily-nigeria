A 45-year-old pastor, Olusola Opoola, on Tuesday told a Grade ‘C’ Customary Court at Inanlende, Ibadan that he married a second wife after his wife, Adeola, persistently denied him sex.

Opoola, who said his decision to marry a second wife was unfortunate, however, pointed out that he needed a woman to satisfy his sexual urge.

He said, “My lord, it is unfortunate that I married another wife because it is morally and spiritually wrong to marry more than one wife.

“My wife pushed me to it, I have endured too long and I do not want to commit adultery.

“I agree to a divorce because she never appreciated all what I have done for her,” he said.

Earlier, Adeola, 36, who had approached the court for divorce, accused her husband of 16 years of snatching the wife of his evangelist.

She said the respondent abandoned her and the four children of the marriage because of his new wife.

Adeola also denied the allegation of refusing him sex.

She said, “He is the one that says I am old and should give another woman a chance.

“He makes life more difficult for me since he married the lady.

“I pray the court to separate us so that I can live comfortably.”

The president of the court, Chief Ramoh Olafenwa, dissolved the marriage and gave the custody of the four children to the plaintiff.

Olafenwa directed the respondent to pay N12,000 monthly for the upkeep of the children.

He also ordered the respondent to be responsible for the education and other bills of the children.
