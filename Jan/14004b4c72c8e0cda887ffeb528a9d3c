A British curry addict who was missing his favourite spicy meal has arranged for his takeaway to be delivered to France.

With a massive delivery arranged through a Facebook group in December, pilot James Emery will be eating his favourite chicken phall curry on Saturday.

After a journey of nearly four hours, the expat and his friends collected their order in person on Saturday.

They ordered a total of 89 meals, 70 side dishes, 75 portions of rice, 100 poppadoms and 10 servings of mango chutney to be flown from Southsea in Hampshire to Bordeaux.

The group of 89 curry lovers have paid £32 each for their meal from the Akash takeaway, which will need to be reheated before being served.

Mr Emery, who is an aviation English assessor for trainee pilots in France, said: “I’m a chilli addict and an aviation geek so I thought I would combine my two hobbies to get my favourite meal to me in France.”

He said that every time he was home and popped into the Akash for a meal “I would complain about the bland and uninspiring version of Indian food we get in France.
