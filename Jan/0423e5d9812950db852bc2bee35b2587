The Chairman of the Presidential Advisory Committee Against Corruption has described former President Olusegun Obasanjo’s letter to President Muhammadu Buhari as insulting.
Obasanjo on Tuesday fired off pages of spanking advice to Buhari, particularly on his nepotism and ambition to seek re-election.

But Prof. Itse Sagay  wondered why Obasanjo, who attempted to get a third term, would advise Buhari not to seek a second term.

“I saw Obasanjo’s comments and I could not believe my eyes, that a man who tried to get a third term is discouraging someone else from getting a second term. It doesn’t make sense,” Sagay said in a The Nation report

“I think Obasanjo should try and respect other people. He has achieved a lot. He is a great man and I respect him. But he should learn to respect other people and think of them as being, at least, as good as himself.

“I think it is insulting for a man who wanted third term to tell somebody else not to want second term. It is most inappropriate, and for a former head of state to say so is most improper.”

Mixed reactions have been pouring out since yesterday when Obasanjo published the open letter in which he condemned the two leading parties, and advocated for a movement he christened Coalition for Nigeria which he declared he will work with to reposition Nigeria.

While the PDP described the letter as patriotic, APGA said Obasanjo should not fuel the already volatile situation.

The Arewa Consultative Forum said Obasanjo is free to say what he likes because it is a democracy, but only Buhari and his party can decide who contests in 2019.
