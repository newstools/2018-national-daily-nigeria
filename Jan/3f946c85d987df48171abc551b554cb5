Ogun State Governor Mr. Ibikunle Amosun, blamed Nigerian politicians for the growing spate of division in the country.
In a welcome address, during a courtesy call on him by members of the State House Press Corps, in Abeokuta, Amosun said the elite class in the country engage in making comments that hurt the country for selfish motives.
He appealed to the media to promote and speak of things that unite rather than divide Nigeria.
Amosun who said their is no nation in the world that has no challenge therefore urged the political class to live above board stressing that “when we speak, we should speak of things that promote unity and peace. This is not a sign of weakeness but rather a sign of strength”.
“We are better together as a nation,” Amosun said adding that “there is no where a part will be better than a whole if it is properly put together. Our diversity should strengthen”.
While thanking the media for the support to the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari, the governor urged them to praise the government where it has done well and constructively criticise it where it has not done well.
