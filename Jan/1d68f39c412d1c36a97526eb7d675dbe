The Yoruba Council of Elders, YCE, has join other leading pan-cultural groups to resist the federal government attempt to establish cattle colonies across the country—a way the government believes it can end the herdsmen-famers violence across the nation.

The YCE said this after the end of its 26th National Executive Council meeting in Ibadan on Thursday.

The group was surprised that no arrest has been made three weeks after the murder of some people in Benue, adding that the way the federal government treats Myetti Allah speaks volume.

Kunle Olajide, secretary-general of the council said,“YCE totally rejects cattle colony and anti-grazing law as solutions to Fulani herdsmen brutality. We believe restructuring is the only solution. Once the restructuring is done, it will solve all these problems.”

“The Federal government is encouraging Nigerians to go into farming. If we are promoting agriculture and Fulani herdsmen move about with their cattle destroying the farmlands. That is a paradox.”

According to them, the zone would never allow any cattle colony which only favours the Fulani herdsmen.

“Cattle-rearing and farming are business ventures. No businessman will expect any government to come and run his business for him”, he said.

Ohaneze Ndigbo and other groups in the south-south have also stood their gound on the policy. The youth wing of one of the southeast bodies has even warned Fulani herders to leave the region.
