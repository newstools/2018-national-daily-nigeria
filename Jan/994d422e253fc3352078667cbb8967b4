The World Igbo Youth Council, WIC, has commended South-east zone of the All Progressives Congress (APC) for supporting President Muhammadu Buhari for 2019 general elections.

The group assured that it would mobilise for the actualisation of the project.

National Vice Chairman, Chief Emmanuel Enukwu, had announced decision of the zone.

Enukwu made the declaration at the Umuahia Township Stadium during a mega rally organized for defectors from other parties​​.

“We believe we can actualize Igbo presidency in APC in 2023; we are solidly behind Mr. President”, he stated.

Reacting, WIC Deputy President General, Dr. Francis Ugwu, in a statement said the group will also campaign for APC to win governorship elections in South-east states.

“Ndigbo have never been in the opposition party since the time of our late leaders Dr. Nnamdi Azikwe, Michael Okpara and Akanu ibiam.

“We will never allow Ohanaeze Ndigbo to repeat the same mistake of not supporting President Buhari.

“World Igbo Youth Council has taken it as a responsibility to rescue Ndigbo from making another costly mistake in 2019 by supporting people who will use restructuring to deceive Ndigbo”, he said.
