A leader of an alleged kidnap gang in Ogun State has confessed his kidnap ring made N8.5 million as ransom from the families of four of their victims.
Oyewumi Musa was one of the 55 suspects paraded by Ogun Police Commissioner Ahmed Iliyasu at the command’s headquarters at Eleweran, Abeokuta on Tuesday for various offences including kidnapping, armed robbery murder, cultism to illegal possession of firearms.
Musa, with10 other members of his gang, said they kidnapped four victims recently and their relatives paid different sums of money as ransoms.
“In the first operation, we got N3m ransom, in the second, we got N2.5m and for the third and fourth, we got N1.5m ransom respectively from their relatives,” he said.
Two members of the gang from Ughelli allegedly link up with gang each time there was an operation.
Iliyasu said a member of the gang, Femi Aresu, was arrested on 5th January 2018 at their hideout in Itele-Ijebu by the operatives of the Federal Special Anti-Robbery Squad and this led to the arrest of other members of the gang.
Aresu led the FSARS operatives to Lagos, Oyo and Ondo states where the “10 other members of the gang were arrested.”

Musa told journalists that their victims were kept inside the bush until their relatives paid the necessary ransom.
Illiyasu vowed the command would continue to rattle the criminals in their hideouts.
“We are not going to rest on our oars and the battle will be taken to doorsteps of the criminals and men of the underworld until Ogun State is rid of all sorts of crimes.”
