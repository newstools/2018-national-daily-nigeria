“In all the town hall meetings, the message has been the same. We have launched ‘Operation Know Your Neighbour’. Knowing our neighbour is a vital aspect of community policing and community safety partnership and that aspect will improve neighbourhood security where at least we get to know what our neighbours do and we would be able to report any wrong doing.“We are expected that wherever we are, either in our homes, in our churches, mosques, business premises, offices, we are expected to know who our neighbour is and what our neighbour does and if there is anything suspicious or untoward, we are expected to pass information quickly to the police in line with community policing,” Edgal said.
