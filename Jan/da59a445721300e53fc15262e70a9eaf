The Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, has said in order to deepen comfort; government is considering hiking the Abuja to Kaduna train service.
In an interview ahead of today’s commissioning of Kaduna Inland Dry Port by President Muhammadu Buhari, he said “When demand outstrips supply then you see all sorts of attempts to cheats the passengers. There are two things I know the president likes, I have mentioned one. “The second one, is after commissioning even the passengers agree that the cost of transportation to Kaduna via the railway is a bit too cheap.
“So, there will be a need to increase the price of the cost and then there will be more comfort. More comfort in the sense that when you have excess seats multiply by the number of passengers that will come, then anybody that wants to racketeer will have to eat the tickets himself.”

Though he kept the new fare hike to himself, Amaechi hinted further that one of the locomotives will be dedicated for a non-stop direct trip from Kaduna to Abuja.
“That should be doing 1:15 or 1:20 minutes non-stop. That will enable those living in Kaduna and working in Abuja to actually come to work on time. If you leave at 6am by 7:15, 7:20 you should be in Abuja,” he said.
