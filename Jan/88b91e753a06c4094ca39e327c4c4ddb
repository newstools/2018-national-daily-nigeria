Former Gov. Kayode Fayemi has been barred from holding any public office in Ekiti for 10 years.

A White Paper released by the state government confirmed the sanction against Fayemi, now minister of sold minerals.

The state also barred his former Commissioner for Finance, Dapo Kolawole, for the same number of years.

The Ekiti Judicial Commission of Inquiry, which indicted the two over alleged mismanagement of the state’s finances between October 2010 and 2014, recommended the sanction.

The report declared them “as unfit to hold any public office in the state.‎”

Fayemi has yet to respond to the ban.
