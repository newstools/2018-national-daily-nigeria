A container carrying military uniforms and weapons has disappeared from the Apapa Port in Lagos. The 14-foot container was said to have been cleared from the port within 24 hours.
Celestine Okoye, the Commissioner of Police, Lagos Ports Command, on Monday, directed his men to trace the container. He has also ordered the arrest of the importer and those fingered in the clearance of the container.
Reports say it had passed through the terminal operation of the port last Friday. Okoye had directed, through a letter, that the container be delayed pending thorough checks.

The container, it was however gathered, was cleared by some port officials who claimed they contacted Marine Police before clearing the arms consignment. They also said they had not received the CP’s letter before contacting the Marine Police.
However, the Marine Police have denied giving any clearance for the container to leave the port.
The police have since rounded up all those involved in its importation on suspicion that they might be the gang that masterminded the importation of dangerous weapons seized at the Port, sometime last year.
The disappearance of the container comes after attacks by gunmen in military uniforms.
