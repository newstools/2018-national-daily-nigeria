The 707 Special Force Brigade of the Nigerian Army has busted a base occupied by armed militias terrorising Benue, Nasarawa and Taraba states at Tor-Dunga Town in the Katsina-Ala Local Government Area of Benue .

The army announced it also arrested a native doctor, Tordue Gber also known by an alias, Tiv Swem, who allegedly supplied charms to the militias.

Director, Army Public Relations Brig Gen Sani Usman said the native doctor was arrested along with one of his accomplices, Atoo Francis.

Francis was, however, shot dead by the troops.

“Troops raided the shrine and arrested Gber, who acted as a spiritual adviser to the criminal militias. Gber is also an ally of the wanted notorious criminal, Akwazar Terwase (alias Gana). It will be recalled that he was declared wanted by the security agencies and has been at large since 2016.

“Preliminary investigation shows that the shrine serves as a hideout for wanted armed militias that operate in Benue, Nasarawa and Taraba states.

“The troops recovered a locally fabricated pistol, two Baretta Pistols, 11 rounds of 9mm ammunition, three motorcycles and assorted charms. Other items include warm clothing for concealing weapons, two mobile telephones and three power generators, amongst other items at the hideout.”

President Muhammadu Buhari has directed the use of maximum force to bring all the perpetrators of killings going on in that axis to justice.

Benue was erupted in violence Jan 1 as herdsmen invaded two communities, killing no fewer than 70 people, and sacking the villages.
