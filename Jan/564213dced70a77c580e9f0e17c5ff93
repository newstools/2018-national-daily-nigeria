The Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON) has finally cleared the air on the allegations leveled against it by former captain of the Super Eagles of Nigeria, Nwankwo Kanu, over Hardley Apartments.
Kanu had accused the corporation of illegally taking over the property over a purported debt to Skye Bank that has not been proven. He alleged that while the case is still in court, AMCON was already planning to sell the property.
However, in its response, AMCON said the former Super Eagles is being economical with the truths concerning his huge debt to Skye Bank which AMCON bought over when he defaulted. 
“AMCON is not in the habit of joining issues with obligors on the pages of the newspapers especially when the matter is in court as in this one. However, as a law abiding recovery agency of the Federal Government of Nigeria, we are at all times guided within the confines of the law and would continue to act accordingly.”

In the statement, AMCON explained that Kanu’s stories were brazen falsehood meant to mislead the public on the true position of the Nwankwo Kanu’s massive indebtedness to the Corporation. 
“We also want to put on record that having exhausted all avenues of peaceful resolution as a result of the huge debt, AMCON in 2015 obtained an order from the Federal High Court, which gave the Corporation permission to take possession of The Hardley Apartments located at No. 46 Waziri Ibrahim Crescent, Off Elsie Femi – Pearse Crescent, Off Adeola Odeku Street, Victoria Island in Lagos State. This order still subsists, pending the determination of the substantive matte”
The corporation therefore advises the public to please therefore disregard the misrepresentations of facts by Kanu Nwankwo as it awaits the pronouncement of the court on the matter.
