Accuse govt of fraud in not fulfilling elelctions promises

The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Right Hon. Yakubu Dogara, took a hot swipe at the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) on Monday, accusing the APC of political manipulation to gain the votes of Nigerians during elections.

Dogara, at a retreat on the Dynamics of Managing Political Parties, organized by the National Institute for Policy and Strategic Studies (NIPSS), Kuru, Jos, this Monday, was cited to have declared inter alia:  “It is worthy to mention that in an attempt to either capture or hold on to power, some political parties have sometimes embellished their manifestoes with unrealistic promises. It is a political malpractice for an elected government to govern without reference to the manifesto that was placed before the voters which essentially formed the basis of their election.”

The Speaker of the House of representative made this submission in the heat of the statement by former President Olusegun Obasanjo highlighting the failures of the APC Government under the leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari.

The APC Government after two and a half years can seldom celebrate any electoral promise made during the electioneering campaign.

The N5,000 welfare stipends to the unemployed, among others still exist in principles.
Perhaps, some APC stakeholders are beginning to have rethink on how to save Nigeria and may by joining forces with a new movement for change in the country towards 2019.
