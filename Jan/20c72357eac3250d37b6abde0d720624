Millions of Nigerians are expected to join the ruling All Progressives Congress in the next few months.

In a letter he sent to Senator Basheer Mohammed, who recently defected to the party in Kano, President Muhammadu Buhari said the defectors would join the party from all parts of the country.

Buhari’s letter was responding to a letter the PDP senator wrote earlier, informing him of his decision to join the ruling party.

The President said he would have loved to attend a welcome reception organised for the federal lawmaker in Kano but for the 30th African Union Summit he was attending in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.

“Furthermore, I am very encouraged to learn that you are bringing thousands of new supporters into the fold,” Buhari wrote in the letter.

“We are expecting millions to join us in the next few months from all parts of the country.

“I hope I shall have the pleasure of welcoming you to the Presidential Villa in the near future. I wish the event turns out to be a resounding success.”

The letter was personally signed by the President.

Lado, who represented Kani Cemtral between 2011 and 2015, took his supporters joined the APC at the Sani Abacha Stadium Kano, on Saturday.

He was received by Deputy National Chairman of the APC, Segun Oni, on behalf of the party’s National Chairman, Chief John Odigie-Oyegun.

Lado lost the seat to the immediate past governor of the state, Rabi’u Kwankwaso, in the 2015 general elections.
