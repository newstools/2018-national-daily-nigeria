Former Arsenal midfielder Alex Song has returned to the club to train and maintain his fitness after being released by Russian side Rubin Kazan.

The 30-year-old joined Kazan on a free transfer in the summer of 2016 when his contract with Barcelona expired.

However, the Russian club have reportedly failed to pay their players for four months and have told Song to find a new club.

It remains to be seen whether Arsene Wenger would consider a late January move for Song in a bid to bolster his ranks for the rest of the season.

On Wednesday, Song posted a picture on Snapchat of himself wearing an Arsenal training top with the caption: ‘No pain, no gain.’

The former Cameroon international was initially at the club between 2005 and 2012, making over 200 appearances.

Song can look forward to training with Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang after Arsenal completed a club-record £56million deal with Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday.

Aubameyang has become the best-paid player in the club’s history on a three-and-a-half-year contract worth £180,000 per week.

The 28-year-old striker is part of a transfer merry-go-round that will see Olivier Giroud leave the Gunners for Chelsea and Michy Batshuayi quit Stamford Bridge to replace Aubameyang at Dortmund.
