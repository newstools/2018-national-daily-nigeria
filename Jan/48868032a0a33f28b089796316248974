The Presidency has reacted to a statement by the General Secretary of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Dr Musa Asake, where he described President Muhammadu Buhari as a threat to the nation’s democracy.

General secretary of CAN Musa Asaka accused President Buhari of having no respect for human rights, rule of law and democracy therefore running Nigeria not according to the dictates of the democratic values in the Constitution.

Reacting, Malam Garba Shehu, the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, in Abuja on Tuesday night condemned the report.

He said CAN could not provide evidence to justify its claims.

Shehu Sani stressed that it was totally wrong for Asake to pass judgment on actions of the Buhari led administration.

The statement read: “Our attention has been drawn to reports of a news conference by General Secretary of Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) Dr Musa Asaka in which he passed a judgment on the constitutionality of certain actions of the Muhammadu Buhari administration.

“Unfortunately, he could not cite any valid cases of constitutional violations. President Muhammadu’s government poses no threat to the country’s democracy and Constitution.

“There are no cases of any violation of our sacred constitution and there will be none under this President.

“The respected religious leader should stick to his religious duties and leave politics for politicians.’’
