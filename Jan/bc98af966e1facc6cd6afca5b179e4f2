President Muhammadu Buhari has ordered the review of the list of the 209 chairmen and 1258 members of governing boards of agencies and parastatal.
Garba Shehu, presidential spokesman, disclosed this on Friday.
Shehu said the list is being reviewed by the office of the secretary to the government of the federation (SGF).
In December last year, Boss Mustapha, the SGF, announced that Buhari had approved the appointments.
The list was, however, filled with errors as at least six of the names on it were those of dead people.
The National Iron Ore Mining Company (NIOMCO), Itakpe, Kogi state which was privatised by this government also had members of its board on the list.
The presidency later explained that the list was compiled in 2015.
On Friday, Shehu said the review of the list is to replace the dead appointees and ensure compliance with the acts establishing the agencies.
“The list is being reviewed against the statutes and the acts establishing the various government agencies,” he said.
“It is to ensure compliance with the various acts establishing the agencies. Obviously, that (replacement of the dead appointees) is also going on simultaneously.”
The presidential spokesman also said one of the appointees whose names was on the list had died.
Shehu, who could not give details, said the deceased was a senior member of the All Progressives Congress (APC) from Adamawa state.
“He was from Adamawa, a senior member of the APC. I can’t remember his name but I know that he was a man of Buhari for so many years,” he explained.
