A man has been arrested for allegedly raping two goats to death, an offence police described as unnatural and unlawful killing of animals.

Mbiti Munyao in Kangundo constituency, Machakos area of Kenya, was taken into custody for a night before he was charged, and bailed for sh100,000â€”about N349,000.

He pleaded not guilty.

According to the area Assistant Chief Mary Mulwa, the man was caught pulling the two goats from a bush where the animals were tied on January 13.

The two goats died after Munyao had sex with them.

The images of the two dead goats and the man in the police station have sparked outrage among Kenyans with most of them condemning the inhumane act.

Bestiality in most countries, including Nigeria, is criminal, but there are usually no tough punishments for the offenders.
