The Lagos State Police Command has dismissed nine policemen found culpable of various offences.

Twenty five other cops were reportedly demoted for offences bordering on gross insubordination, incivility and drunkenness, among others.

According to a statement the state Police Public Relations Officer, SP Chike Oti issued Jan. 2, no fewer than 60 rank and files also faced disciplinary action for misconduct.

In the break down contained in the statement, the command said:
“Nine officers were dismissed for offences ranging from discreditable conduct, corrupt 
practices, disobedience to lawful order and falsehood.

“Twenty five were reduced in rank for offences ranging from gross insubordination, drunkenness, incivility to members of the public and leaving (their) beat.

“A total of 60 inspectors and rank and files were awarded the punishments of major and minor entries.”

Commissioner of Police Imohimi Edgar said the punishments handed down to the unruly officers would serve as a deterrent to others who may wish to toe the path of ignominy.
