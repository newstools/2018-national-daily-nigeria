Musician and father-of-two, Davido and his current girlfriend, Chioma stepped out together for his family event in Ede, Osun state yesterday.
They’ve been dating for a while now and if Davido’s Snapchat posts are to be taken serious, he’s certainly in love with her. We may soon be in for some serious Igbo wedding ceremony.
The good thing here is that no matter how expensive the Igbo dowry and ceremony is, it will be a piece of cake for the FIA crooner.
