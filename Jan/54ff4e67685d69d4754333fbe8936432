The Ilado farm of a former Secretary to the Government of the Federation Olu Falae has been burnt by hoodlums suspected to be Fulani herdsmen on Sunday.

The extent of damage on the oil palm plantation cannot be assessed yet, according to Falae’s personal assistant Moshood Raji.

There was no worker on the farm when the incident occurred because it was a Sunday. We have informed the Commissioner of Police. About five hectares of the land were affected,”he said.

Some parts of the yam and cassava plantations were also affected.

Falae himself said the herdsmen were deliberately attacking his farm for no reason, and that was the third time they would be attacking his farm between in January 2016 and now.

That is how they burn it every year so that fresh grass can come out for their cattle to eat,” he said.
