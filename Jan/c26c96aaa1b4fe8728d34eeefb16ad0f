A 25-year-old commercial bus driver, John Okoye, who allegedly drove recklessly, causing his conductor to fall off the vehicle and die, was on Monday brought before an Ojo Magistrates’ Court in Lagos.

Okoye, who resides at Adensin Street,  Igando, a Lagos suburb, is facing a charge of manslaughter.

The Police Prosecutor, Insp. Uche Simeon, told the court that the accused committed the offence on April 14, 2017, at 8pm along Iyana-Iba/Igando Road, Ojo Lagos.

Simeon said that the accused, on the fateful day, drove his Volkswagen bus with Registration No. LND 374 XU in a reckless manner.

“The conductor, Matthias Nwoge, fell off the bus in motion due to the driver’s reckless driving while in a haste to carry passengers at the bus stop.”
