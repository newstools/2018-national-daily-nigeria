The trial of Ex-Aviation minister, Femi Fani-kayode, has been postponed due to health reasons.

Norris Quakers, SAN, Fani-Kayode’s lawyer on Wednesday told the judge his client could not attend proceedings due to “heart-related” ailments.

He said the ex-minister was complaining of a heart-related pain and would provide a medical report later today.

Fani-Kayode and Nenadi Usman, a former minister of state for finance, are facing a 17-count of money laundering amounting to N4.6 billion.
