The National Institute for Pharmaceutical Research and Development, NIPRD, says it has developed six herbal products for the treatment of Ebola, malaria and other diseases.
Karniyus Gamaliel, NIPRD director-general, made this known while presenting the scorecard of his eight-year tenure (2009-2017) in Abuja on Friday.
He said ‘NIPRIBOL’; a fixed dose combination drug was developed by the institute for the treatment of Ebola virus disease, adding that the institute had completed the phase I study of the drug.
Gamaniel said the institute had also developed ‘NIPRIMAL’ for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria, stating that the drug was also safe for use by pregnant women.
Other drugs developed are: ‘NIPRIMUNE’ an immunostimulant which can also be used to manage HIV in Nigeria and ‘NIPRIFAN’ for the treatment of fungal skin infection.
He said the NIPRD oil can be used as a nasal decongestant, insect repellant, air freshner, and anti-inflammatory agent.
Gamaniel, however, said excessive use of the oil could cause irritation.
“The institute has also developed ‘NIPRISAN’ for the management of sickle cell anaemia. We are currently concluding plans to carry out commercial production and distribution of this product,” he said.
“We have also ensured the introduction of traditional herbal medicine into the national health system and established partnerships with local and international organisations.
“The core competence of NIPRD is in the development of phytomedicines from indigenous plants and products, clinical trials, among others; we are a quality assured institute.”
The institute was established in 1987 under the ministry of science and technology and moved to the ministry of health in 2001.
