The Federal High Court in Abuja has thrown out the application by the Indigenous People of Biafra to reverse the court’s order proscribing and designating it a terrorist organisation.
It also awarded N500 as cost against IPOB.

Acting Chief Judge of the Federal High Justice Abdu Kafarati on Thurday resolved all the three formulated issues against the group, and held that the September 20, 2017 proscription order was validly issued.

Kafarati dismissed the argument of IPOB’s lawyer Ifeanyi Ejiofor, who contended that IPOB not being registered in Nigeria but only registered in some other countries, could not be sued in Nigeria.

The judge noted that an organisation registered abroad could be likened to a foreigner who could be arrested in another country where he was found to have committed a crime.

He held that the earlier proscription order by him in chambers following an ex parte application was in accordance with the provisions of the Terrorism Prevention Act.
