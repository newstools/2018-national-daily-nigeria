Another armed robbery and kidnap kingpin, who participated in the New Year attack in Omoku, Rivers State was on Thursday, has been paraded at the Force Headquarters, Abuja.

The 32-year-old suspect, Desmond Okotubo, who is a father of three, hails from Egbenma in Unelga Local Government Area of Rivers State.

He told newsmen in Abuja that, “the arrest and humiliation of the mother of Don Waney, coupled with the destruction of Waney’s mansions was the main reason for the New Year attack in Omoku.”

He also revealed, “that the plan to invade Omoku was hatched in Owerri, Imo State,” adding that Omoku vigilante group members were their original targets and not church worshippers.

Okotubo further explained that their decision to vent their anger on the worshippers came when they could not track down the vigilante group members.

He said vigilante members were instrumental to the arrest of Don Waney’s mother and tracing of his mansions for destruction by government.
