The weekly Federal Executive Council meeting at Aso Rock had some side attraction early in the meeting today: campaign caps with the inscription: “Continuity ’19: Muhammadu Buhari/Osinbajo”.

This is coming less than 24 hours after former President Olusegun Obasanjo score the APC government low in many areas.

The South West Campaign Coordinator and Minister of Communications, Adebayo Shittu, was reportedly behind the production of the caps brought in bagfuls to the officers of the Cabinet Office at the Council Chamber to distribute to the ministers in attendance.

Shittu is aspiring to contest the governorship election on the platform of the All Progressives Congress, APC, in Oyo.


The minister  is one of the governors and ministers already mobilising to push Buhari into the 2019  contest though the president has yet to make up his mind.
