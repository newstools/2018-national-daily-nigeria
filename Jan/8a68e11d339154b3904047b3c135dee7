The Edo State Police Command has arrested three suspects that specialize in cobbling up items used for making Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs).

Idris Ibrahim, Zainab Ibrahim and Oyeza Abdul are all from Kogi, and were arrested at Okugbe, near Iddo village in Okpella, Estako East Local Government Area.

Oyesa’s husband, Idris Hassan Abdulmalik, who is the lynchpin,  is now on the fly.

The three were paraded at the Edo State Police Command Headquarters where Commissioner of Police Babatunde Kokumo told journalists that the Police Anti-bomb Squad was called in to detonate some of the explosives, while others were taken away.

According to him, Abdulmalik escaped through a footpath in a bush after he was prevented by vigilant youths from fleeing in his Toyota Corolla with registration number ABC 371 HK.
