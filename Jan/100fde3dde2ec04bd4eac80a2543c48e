A 42-year-old housewife, Fatimot Abiola, on Wednesday in Lagos lost her 22-year marriage to her husband, Rasheed, for wearing trousers against her husband’s wish.

Delivering the judgment, the President of Igando Customary Court, Lagos, Mr. Akin Akinniyi, said it appeared that the estranged couple were tired of the marriage and all efforts to reconcile both parties had failed.

“Since both parties consented to the dissolution of their marriage, this court has no choice than to dissolve the marriage.

The court pronounced the marriage between Mr. Rasheed Abiola and Mrs. Fatimot dissolved, both parties henceforth cease to be husband and wife.

“Both are free to go their separate ways without any hindrance and molestation,” Akinniyi ruled.

Abiola had earlier told the court that his wife wears trousers which he had warned her several times to desist from, but she refused.

“I can no longer cope with her way of life and her defiant attitude,” he said.

The 47-year-old customs officer said his wife also threatened to harm him if he takes another wife.

“Fatimot is threatening to harm me if I make any attempt to marry another woman. But Fatimot and I have not been sleeping together as husband and wife for years.

“She once left the house and never returned until after a year,” the estranged husband said.

According to him, he is experiencing depression because he does not have peace of mind.
He begged the court to dissolve the union, saying he did not love her anymore.

However, Fatimot said her husband kicked against her wearing trousers, claiming she wanted to be a prostitute.

She said she never threatened him not to marry another wife.

The mother of three children urged the court to grant her husband’s wish.
