A robbery suspect has died in the custody of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad, Lagos State Police Command.
Lukman Ogundele, an auto parts dealer in Owode Onirin, Lagos, was arrested and detained alongside two others for selling a stolen vehicle last December.
Their families, however, didn’t know the whereabouts of the three until December 31 when they got to the Ikeja office of the squad known for extra-judicial killing and rights violations.
The operatives would not allow the families to see the suspects until lately when it was discovered that Lukman was not among those to be arraigned at the Ikeja magistrate court.
According to Lukman’s mother, our family members went to the SARS office, but the policemen did not give them any attention
She explained she later met with an official at the court, who showed them the charge of robbery preferred against her son.
“His name on the heading of the charge sheet had been cancelled, but in the content, it was written as late Lukman Ogundele. That was when I realised that my son died in the police custody,{“ she said.
According the Lagos State Police Public Relations Officer, SP Chike Oti, said Lukman died naturally on January 2, adding that the victim’s relatives were informed about the death through a family member, who is a policeman.
“The boy was arrested for armed robbery with four others. Along the line, he was sick while in the cell and was taken to the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital, Ikeja. The doctor treated him and the police took him back. He was returned to custody,” he said.
“The next day, he collapsed and was rushed back to the hospital. On getting to the hospital, he was confirmed dead by a doctor. Other gang members have been arraigned and remanded in prison.”
The family has contacted a lawyer to take up the case.
