A panel set up by the Nigeria Football Federation to  look into the issues which led to Nigeria being sanctioned by the world football ruling body (FIFA) met for the second time National Daily gathered.

The panel had its second meeting in Abuja during the week after the first meeting in Lagos.

The Chairman of the committee Barrister Seyi Akinwunmi was spotted at the Glass House today when he snuck into town this morning and rushed  to the airport this evening saying he came in for some meetings at the request of the NFF President who was out of the country National Daily learnt.

National Daily gathered that the Secretary of the Committee was also spotted at the Glass House recently and investigations revealed that they met with  few senior members of staff individually in a bid to  unravel the issues behind the slip that led to FIFA’s Disciplinary action against Nigeria.

Prior to this time, the General Secretary, Super Eagles technical adviser, the secretary of team and other personnel had given their own accounts.

Now after a thorough investigation, the committee is expected to submit its report to the NFF  before the end of the month as per the exrension of time given to the committee.

If you recall, Nigeria was sanctioned by FIFA to forfeit  the 2018 FIFA World Cup Africa Zone Final Qualifying Group B match against Algeria in Constantine played on Nov. 10.

The match which was both teams’ concluding match in the series had ended in a 1-1 draw, but FIFA awarded all three points to Algeria.

The match is declared to be forfeited and awarded 3-0 in favour of Algeria, with the NFF
also receiving a fine of 6,000 Swiss Francs.

This was as a result of Nigeria’s use of ineligible defender Shehu Abdullahi in the encounter.

The Committee members are, Barrister Seyi Akinwunmi, Ibrahim Gusau and Felix Anyansi-Agwu,  with Mohammed Saidu, Chairman of Sokoto State Football Association,
serve as member/secretary.
