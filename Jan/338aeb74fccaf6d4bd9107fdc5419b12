Argentina forward, Angel Di Maria has looked beyond the group stage of the 2018 World in Russia by insisting that Barcelona super star, Lionel Messi would win the tournament for La Albiceleste.

Argentina will face Iceland, Croatia and Nigeria in the Group D of the tournament in June but Di Maria sees France and Spain as only teams that can challenge his country for the trophy.

Di Maria was part of the Argentine squad that lost 1-0 to current champions Germany 1-0 in the finals of the competition in Rio in 2014.

“Argentina is always one of the favourites, first of all because we have Lionel Messi,” Di Maria told www.sc.qa.

“There are other teams playing at a high level, like Spain and France, but Argentina is among the best.

“We have to keep working hard to remain at the top level. World Cup tournaments are always different to the qualifying rounds. If you don’t win, you go home, and that makes the games very special.

“Messi is already the greatest.

“Winning the World Cup would validate him, but he is already the best. Hopefully, football will give Messi this World Cup – it would be good for everyone.

“Messi has achieved everything in his career – the only thing missing is a World Cup. Obviously, as an Argentine and a team-mate of his, I would love for it to happen in Russia,” he said.
