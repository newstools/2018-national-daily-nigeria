Chelsea striker Alvaro Morata says Real Madrid will suffer if Barcelona sign Philippe Coutinho.

Barca are expected to complete the signing of the Liverpool star this month.

And according to Spanish news outlet Diario Gol, Morata has sent a warning message to Real.

The Spain international has told Real president Florentino Perez that Real will fall behind Barca if they sign Coutinho.

Morata, who left Real in the summer in a Â£70m move to Stamford Bridge, is a huge admirer of the Liverpool playmaker and he knows the Brazilian will improve Barca.
