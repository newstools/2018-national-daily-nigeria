Arsenal forward, Alexis Sanchez, has sent a tribute to Chelsea midfielder, Cesc Fabregas, reminding him of their time together in Barcelona after the 2-2 draw at the Emirate on Wednesday.

Rivalry between both clubs did not prevent Sanchez and Fabregas from sharing a moment during the 2-2 draw on Wednesday evening.

Right-back, Hector Bellerin rescued a late point for Arsene Wenger’s side after Marcos Alonso appeared to have secured victory for the Premier League champions.

Fabregas, a former Arsenal captain, was given a warmer reception than usual and was even applauded by some Gunners fans.

In the first half, the Chelsea midfielder was taken out by Sanchez and was promptly awarded a free kick.

The Chilean looked shocked with the decision as Fabregas got to his feet, it looked as though he was going to have some harsh words for the Arsenal forward, but instead, Sanchez and Fabregas hugged.

After the match, Sanchez took to Instagram to post some photos, reminding fans of the moment, as well as the fact that the pair remain good friends following their time together at Barcelona.

Responding, Fabregas also thanked Arsenal fans for their reception. He wrote, “Great game at the Emirates. Should have won,’ he posted on social media.

“Thank you once again for the reception. We go again on Saturday. Thank you to the traveling fans, great as usual.”
