Real Madrid stars are reportedly turning against Cristiano Ronaldo as the dressing room unrest at the Bernabeu deepens.

Zinedine Zidane’s men are 16 points behind Barcelona in the title race following a dismal start to the campaign.

Ronaldo scooped his fifth Ballon d’Or in 2017 but the Portuguese star has managed just four league goals for his club and has come under fire for his poor form.

And it has been claimed that Ronaldo’s teammates are unhappy with the 32-year-old.

Diario Gol says Isco, Marcos Asensio, Lucas Vazquez, Dani Ceballos and Sergio Ramos have all grown tired of the former Manchester United star’s ego.

Meanwhile, Zidane has ruled out any January reinforcements, despite their struggles.
