Leicester manager Claude Puel has hailed the performances of Nigerian midfielder Wilfred Ndidi, claiming he has been the club’s best player this season.

The Foxes host Bournemouth on Saturday at the King Power Stadium looking to move up to seventh in the table, and Ndidi will be available for the visit of the Cherries.

Puel sees the 21-year-old as a key component of his side with the player making more tackles than anyone else in the Premier League this season.

“Since the beginning of the season, Wilfred is the most consistent player because he plays well, he recovers a lot of ball,” said Puel.

“Perhaps in his last game (against Stoke), like his team-mates, he was not fantastic. But since the beginning of the season, he’s improved a lot, he continues to work with good spirit in the training sessions, always correct.

“He is a valuable player for us because we didn’t have a lot of players with the same attributes. He can recover a lot of balls, he is strong in the duels and now, when he plays simple with quality, he can give a good start in our play.”

Eddie Howe hopes Bournemouth will not need to produce another late show when they take on Leicester after the Cherries fought back from 2-0 down at half-time to earn a point from a home draw with Newcastle last weekend.
