The Engineer Musa Kida led Nigeria Basketball Federation board has congratulated the head coach of Erie Community College, Buffalo, Alex Nwora who was recently voted as the coach of the year at the end of the National Junior College Athletic Association Region III Tournament.
Kida in a congratulatory message to Nwora described the award as well deserved for the seasoned coach who has continued to display a high level of professionalism.
The NBBF president said this was coming at the right time when the national team is rounding off preparations for the Commonwealth Games in Australia.
“I was so delighted when I heard the news. As a board, we are also happy that this award is coming at such a strategic time that we will be going to the Commonwealth Games. It has vindicated our decision to appoint you as D’Tigers coach to lead the team as we seek to rebuild the brand with Nigerians in charge.
“When you were appointed, many people asked questions. We told them to trust the process and have faith because we collectively saw something in you.”
According to him, “With a silver medal finish at the 2017 Afrobasket, a 100% record so far in the 2019 FIBA World Cup qualifiers and leading your college to the 2018 regional title and qualifying for the National finals, it shows that our trust in you is paying off.”
The latest honor is his 8th individual regional award in 17 years of coaching the Erie Community College basketball team.
He advised Coach Nwora to never take his eyes off the mark as he prepares his team for the NJCAA Division II National Championship Tournament between March 20th-24th in Danville, Illinois.
Nwora has an all-time record of 369 wins and 168 losses with the team.
