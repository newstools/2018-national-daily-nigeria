Former governor of Anambra has explained what a Nigerian governor earns will cause a greater stir when compared to a senator’s—N13.5 million monthly.
Peter Obi said this as a panelist at the dialogue organised by Ripples Centre for Data and Investigative Journalism in Lagos on Thursday in Lagos.
“None of you knows what a governor earns,” he said.
 “It is something you can’t imagine. You just know the one of senators, and you are shouting. But what if you know that of the governors?”
According to him, America’s is way above Nigeria’s but an American senator earns $174,000 (about N50 million) a year.
“In America, governors earn according to their state,’ he said.
“The governor of California is the highest paid in America, and he earns $192, 000. The smallest state earns $70, 000.
“But in Nigeria, I can tell you because I’ve been there,” he said, adding that the cost of just keeping convoys alone is in millions.
“And when people ask me why am I saying these things, I tell them that even if we made mistakes yesterday, can’t we correct it today?”
Known as a nickel-nurser amongst Nigerian governors when he was in office, Obi reduced the vehicles in his convoy to four, and he never used a bulletproof car for the eight years he spent in office.
“I didn’t stop it because of them following me, but the cost of maintaining them was high. I asked them why do we need to spend about N30 million fueling these vehicles that 60 percent are empty when following me?” he said.
Apart from their undisclosed earnings while inoffice, many of the states have laws that ensure the former governors earn pension running to millions, and perks like vehicles and houses in their states and the FCT.
Only Kwara recently repealed the law.
