Youths in Ogoni land, under the auspices of Ogoni Youth development Initiatives has warned on a pseudo and portfolio group called Ken Saro Wiwa Associates to stop denigrating the revered stools of Monarchs of Ogoni kingdom.
 
In statement  signed by the President of the group,  comrade Imeabe Saviour  Oscar, the ken Saro wiwa associates is never known or recognized in the land as it is  only Supreme council of Traditional Rulers of Ogoni, Kagote and Mosop that can speak for  Ogoni on all issues affecting Ogoni Ethnic Nationality.
 
“Ken Saro wiwa associates is only known in Ogoniland as a mere  portfolio and one-man group purely involved in commercial activities and playing the dictates  of its paymaster, hence it will be worthless joining issues with a one-man group carrying a briefcase about looking for who it will sell Ogoni to,” Oscar said in the statement.

According to him, he said the is the need to question Mr. Gani Topba’s source of sudden prosperity and Coastal Bus if he was not being sponsored by a desperate oil prospecting company whose sole aim is to destabilize and disorganize the present peace and tranquility in Ogoniland.
 
“The Ogoni Youth Development Initiatives therefore stand by and are fully in support of the actions of not just the the Supreme Council Of Traditional Rulers of Ogoni, but the leadership of Kagote and Mosop, the only leadership and Recognise Organizations in Ogoniland Kingdom who have the full mandate of the Ogoni people to speak on its behalf.”

“To this end, we are calling on Gani Topba the self-appointed coordinator of the ken Saro wiwa Associates to immediately tender an unreserved apology to constituted Authorities in Ogoniland, Especially the Supreme Council of Traditional Rulers of Phone for his unguided utterances and high level of insultive Criticism.”
