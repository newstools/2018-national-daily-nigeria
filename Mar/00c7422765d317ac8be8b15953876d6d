President Muhammadu Buhari recently announced the Federal Government’s plan to aim at a regime of self-sufficiency in food production and consumption by radically cutting down on agricultural imports.
 
Buhari said this while receiving a Letter of Credence from the High Commissioner of Republic of Singapore to Nigeria, Lim Sim Seng, at the State House, Abuja.
 
He said the era of high import bills on food was fast becoming a thing of the past with growing investments in the agricultural sector, favourable weather and the collective will of Nigerians to start feeding themselves, and exporting products.
 
We are happy that you are also looking at the agricultural sector because it is integral to our economic blueprint for diversifying the economy,’’ Buhari said.
 
The president noted that bilateral relations with Singapore will be further strengthened to enable both countries enjoy the benefits of competitive advantage. He said this was most needed in the exchange of ideas and technology that will enhance growth and improvement in the livelihood of citizens.
 
Buhari, who also received Letters of Credence from the High Commissioner of Republic of The Philippines, Shirley Ho-Vicaria, and High Commissioner of the Republic of Uganda, Nelson Ocheger, assured the countries of Nigeria’s cooperation on economic, security and diplomatic issues.
 
In his response, the High Commissioner of Singapore said his country could go into partnership with Nigeria in exchange of technical skills, training of entrepreneurs and public servants.
Describing Nigeria as the “big brother of Africa’’, Seng said an investment in the country will naturally result in growth for the entire continent.
