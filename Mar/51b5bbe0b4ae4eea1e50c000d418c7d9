Fulanis in Taraba state, especially cattle breeders have appealed to the Inspector General of Police, Ibrahim Idris, to protect them from rampaging youths in the state.


Danburam, Chairman of North-East zone of the Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN) made the appeal on Tuesday, accusing Darius Ishaku, governor of Taraba state, of bias.

Danburam expressed dismay over the alleged non-intervention of Ishaku in the “killings of Fulani” in the state. He said the Fulani could not travel in the state without military escort in order to prevent loss of their lives.
 
“We are disturbed and disappointed with the lackadaisical approach of the state government to the crisis. We have lost confidence in the Taraba state government,” the statement read.

“This approach has proved to the Fulani that they, in Taraba state, are always victims without saviour of which we term the system as one-sided and uncalled for.

“Upon all the killings only the Fulani have been arrested and detained. Other tribes are left to work freely in the streets. A Fulani man that is leaving in Ussa and Takum local government council of Taraba state is no longer free to travel from his community to any other part of the state without military escort because of fear to lose his life.”
