Making good their threat to override President Muhammadu Buhari’s veto in the Electorail Act 2010 amnedmnet, the Senate has reontroduced the bill afresh.

A new bill on the amendment is to be presented and passed for first reading today, according to the Order Paper for today’s plenary.

After he second and the third reading, the bill will become a law without an assent by the executive.

The House of Representatives re-introduced the bill last week.

The bill seeks to reorder the sequence of polls during a general election.

The controversy that ensued after the NASS paased it has polarised the legisitalure into Buhari and Senate President Bukola Saraki blocs.

There are now pro-Buhari lawmakers and pro-Saraki lawmakers.

Both have gathered signatures of supporters needed to form a quorom that will override Buhari or counter the pro-Saraki camp.

The NASS has the ruling APC as the majority in both chambers, and many of the lawmakers are apparently undermining their party leaders by joining forces to override his veto.

But the pro-Saraki lawmakers believe all is welcome in a democracy.
