A 20- year old lady has been left permanently blind after she intentionally scratched out her own eyes and was seen holding an eyeball  in front of a church in South Carolina.

The young woman- who doctors believe was high on tainted methamphetamine — reportedly started fighting off people who were trying to help her.

Experiencing delusions, she believed that the world was “upside down” and that she needed to “sacrifice her eyes” to go to heaven.

Emergency responders were eventually able to render aid and fly her to Greenville Memorial Hospital, where she remains in recovery.

Her mother, Katy Tompkins, said that she arrived at the hospital to find out that her daughter was now blind.

“That was a struggle, I can’t even explain that feeling when I found out, it was horrifying. Complete terror,” said Ms Tompkins. “I was thankful she was alive, but I knew something was wrong with her.”

The 20-year-old, however, will have to get prosthetics in order to maintain her facial structure, according to doctors.

According to report, Kaylee remains hospitalised where she will receive prosthetic eyeballs. When she is released she will learn to live without sight and warn other young people about the dangers of drug use.

“If Kaylee’s story can help just one person, something good can come of this tragedy in our family. We are truly grateful for all the prayers and help we’ve received thus far and ask that you give whatever you can and continue to pray for us. The sooner we can provide Kaylee with a service dog, the sooner we can help her get back on her feet,” Katy Tompkins.
