Facts are beginning to emerge over statements credited to the Lagos state governor that the land Use act has not been reviewed in the last 15 years necessitating the hike of the charges in the new law passed by the state House of Assembly on January 29, 2018.

Justifying the increase in LUC, Ambode said the law had not been reviewed since 2001. But contrary to Ambode’s claim that the law has never been reviewed, National Daily gathered that the law has been reviewed three times.

After the original bill was signed into law in 2001, it was reviewed by the administrations of Bola Tinubu and Babatunde Fashola, former governors of the state. While Tinubu reviewed it in 2003, Fashola did so in 2008 and 2012.

In 2003, Tinubu set up a special committee chaired by Lateef Okunnu, the renowned lawyer, to review the law. At the end of its sitting, the committee published a communique. One of the recommendations was a downward review of the rates.

Commercial properties were then charged at 0.375%, residential property/commercial at 0.125%, industrial premises of manufacturing concerns at 0.125%, owner-occupied/residential property at 0.0375, owner-occupied pensioner property and family compound/public were also exempted.
 
In 2012 under Fashola, the administration of reviewed the charge to reflect an increase in all categories except pensioners, family compounds and religious properties.

As of the last review in 2012, commercial properties attracted a rate of 0.394%; a property solely occupied by the owner for residential purpose was charged at a rate of 0.0394%; while a similar property occupied by the property owner and tenant(s) or third parties will be charged at a rate of 0.132%. An investment property fully occupied by tenants or third party (ies) for revenue generation, was charged at a rate of 0.394%.”

Reacting to the controversy on the review of the law, Kehinde Bamigbetan, commissioner for information said the bill was repealed under the Ambode administration. He admitted that the previous administrations reviewed the law.

“What happened in 2012 is a review; what is happening now is a repeal. In 2012, parts of the law were reviewed but what is happening now is a total transformation of the law,” he said.

According to the new law, “a property solely occupied by the owner for a residential purpose will be charged at a rate of 0.076 percent per annum. A property occupied by the owner and tenant(s) or third parties will be charged 0.256 percent per annum, while an investment property fully occupied by tenants or third party(ies) for revenue generation will be charged at 0.76 percent per annum.”

The law prescribes that a property shall be liable to enforcement if payment is not made after 135 days of notice. But after high wave of criticisms and condemnation, the government extended the period of implementation till April 14, 2018.
