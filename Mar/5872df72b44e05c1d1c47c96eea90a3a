Britain’s Robin Deakin has announced his retirement from boxing with immediate effect.
Rockin’ Robin, who promotes himself as “Britain’s worst boxer”, made a name for himself after losing a remarkable 51 bouts in a row.
 
The boxer announced his retirement on social media on Sunday, March 11, saying he “can’t take no more”.
Deakin turned professional after a successful amateur career which saw him win 40 out of 75 bouts, including making it to the semi-finals of the British Youth Championships. He could not replicate his teenage successes when he turned pro in 2006, winning just two of his 55 professional bouts.
Despite his lack of success, the boxer says he is proud of what he achieved throughout his career.
“I have done more than most people will ever do in boxing,” said the 31-year-old.
“I have boxed people at venues where people only dream about. I have boxed at the Wembley Arena so I have done more than most people.
“I have boxed on big undercards which involved Amir Khan and David Haye and I am proud of what I achieved even though I wasn’t as successful.
“For me, personally, I have had 55 fights but only won two of them. I think Eddie was a bit wary as I have caused his boys problems in the past but it wasn’t to be.
“I have been in the ring with British champions so the calibre of fighters I have been in the ring with is quite high. I personally think he was a bit scared.”
