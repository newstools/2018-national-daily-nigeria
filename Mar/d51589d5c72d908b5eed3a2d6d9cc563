Chairman of Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN) in Plateau state, Muhammed Nuru Abdullahi says the controversial ID card found at a murder scene belonging to the association’s Deputy Chairman in Bassa local government area of Plateau state, Zakariya Ya’u idris was stolen.

The controversial identity card has become a subject of controversy following the claims by Irigwe Development Association that the document was recovered at a scene where some persons were recently killed by suspected Fulani herdsmen.

The President of IDA and former member, Plateau State House of Assembly, Sunday Abdu, claimed they not only recovered the identity card at the scene, but also telephone handsets “We have reported the matter to the Police and the items have been taken for investigation.”

However, Abdullahi debunked such claims, insisting the documents were stolen when some youths attacked Idris house. “He left this document inside his own house, and they entered and picked it and then went away with it. The man was running for his life.”

“The incident happened on Wednesday morning. You know they were attacked very early in the morning before 6:00am. He was in the mosque when they were attacked and he was unable to come back to his house.
 
“That was how they picked the documents, including the school certificates of his children, indigene’s certificates of his wife and children, his (MACBAN) identity card, vehicle documents and other personal items.
“He has reported to the Police and the report has been documented.”

When contacted to find out whether any report was lodged by either parties, the spokesperson of Plateau State Police Command, Matthias Tyopev, an Assistant Superintendent of Police said, “It is a sensitive matter; no comment for now, until after diligent investigation.”
