Former Super Eagles coach, Samson Siasia has predicted that the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) will run back to him to rescue the country after the 2018 World Cup in Russia, National Daily learnt.
The USA 1994 World Cup star humorously accused the NFF of killing their best coaches (in apparent reference to late Amodu Shuaibu and Stephen Keshi), and insists that after the World Cup they will have nowhere to run to but him, National Daily gathered.
He also advised the NFF to avoid a fire brigade approach while preparing towards major competition.
Samson explained that Nff will still  run back to me after the World Cup, because they have killed their best coaches. I won’t say no to my country.’’
Siasia told NationalDaily that “We need to change our ways. We should have a plan ahead of major competitions, fire brigade approach will not help us.’’.
