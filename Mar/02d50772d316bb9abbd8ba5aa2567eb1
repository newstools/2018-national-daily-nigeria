Postpones the meeting to two weeks’ time
Promises to write Parties concerned for invitation




It will be recalled that the Players’ Union was forced to write to the Labour minister to complain about the  LMC chairman, Shehu Dikko after he failed in several  attempts since 2016 to sign a document that will make Nigerian league be in line with the global Football practice and standard as contained in various Football Rules of FIFA and National laws.
With good intention to bring a lasting solution to the unending disharmony and lack of understanding between League Management Company, LMC, and National Assosciation of Nigerian Professional Footballers, NANPF, the minister of labour and employment comes in order to put the matter to rest and scheduled a meeting between LMC, TUC and NANPF  billed for yesterday at the conference hall of the ministry of labour and  employment. All  bodies invited for the meeting were present by 11am on the day of the meeting but the Director of Labour, Mrs. Amahian J.E, who represented the honourable minister, was not happy with the absence of  LMC.
After two weeks of invitation, LMC wrote a letter to the ministry in the morning of the meeting stating their reasons for absence, which is done in a delibrate attempt to frustrate every plan that will put an end to their refusal to sign the collective bargaining agreement (CBA) documents.
The ministry in its magmanity has rescheduled the meeting till after Easter break and promises to write all parties concerned for invitation.
