As bloodshed continues in Plateau despite President Muhammadu Buhari’s official visit, the state’s chiefs and emirs are worried about the audacity of the Fulani herders believed to be unleashing the mayhem.
“But of great concern is the fact that when Mr. President was still here, there were very serious killings in Bokkos Local Government Area and Bassa LGA here, particularly in Irigwe chiefdom that is very close,’ said HRH Buba Gyang.
The Gbwogwom of Jos and Chairman of the Plateau State Council of Chiefs and Emirs said this during the council’s quarterly meeting in his palace on Thursday.
 “One wonders that while Mr. President was here, despite the security coverage that accompanied Mr. President wherever he goes, there were still these happenings so close to where Mr. President was when he visited Plateau.”
The monarchs are calling on the government to intervene and intensify efforts at ending the bloodshed.
The council also dismissed the conclusion that the killings in the state are communal clashes.
“They are normal security challenges involving farmers and herdsmen, armed robbery and many others,” said Gyang.
“What we have witnessed in Bokkos and Irigwe chiefdoms in Bassa cannot be interpreted as communal clashes. To the best of my knowledge the attackers came from outside. The villagers don’t go outside to attack.”
The council condemned these killings in Plateau, and  in different parts of the country, calling on government at all levels to intervene and intensify efforts to ensure that sanity reigns in Nigeria.
Present at the meeting included the Long Geomai Shendam, HRH Miskoom Shaldas 3rd, Long Tehl, HRH Donal Puntel, Emir of Wase, HRH Alhaji Mohammed Sambo Haruna, Emir of Kanam, Alhaji Babangida Muazu Mohammadu, and others.
