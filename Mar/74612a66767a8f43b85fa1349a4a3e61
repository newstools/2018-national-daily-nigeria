Liverpool legend Jamie Carragher claims Mohamed Salah is more like Cristiano Ronaldo than he is Lionel Messi.

Salah has been phenomenal in his first Premier League campaign, bagging 31 goals in all competitions for Liverpool after arriving from Roma in the summer for £39.6million.

The Egyptian has inevitably been compared to Messi, who has regularly operated in the same position on the right wing, dribbles like Salah and has as devastating a left foot.

But Carragher is convinced it is the other great of the game Salah should be compared to.

He wrote in the Telegraph: ‘Cristiano Ronaldo is the prime example of how the role [of wide forward] has changed.

‘When he joined Manchester United he liked hugging the touchline, performing his step-overs and terrorising right-backs.

‘Now he is completely different player – a goalscorer more than provider. He is disappointed if he comes off the pitch and has not scored.

‘He does not want to be indulging in his party tricks out wide because he cannot shoot from there, so his game is all about cutting inside and getting into the penalty area to swell those extraordinary numbers.

‘That is why although there has been some comparisons made between Salah’s style and that of Lionel Messi – obviously he is not at the level of either Messi or Ronaldo yet – the Liverpool forward has more of Ronaldo’s approach about him.

‘Messi likes to come deeper for the ball and involve himself in the build-up. That is not Salah’s way. He has the mindset of a prolific striker, as demonstrated by how disappointed he is whenever he is substituted late in a match as he craves more goals. It is refreshing to see.’
