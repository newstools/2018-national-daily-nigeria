The National Assembly has passed the National Transport Commission Bill after ten years it was being sponsored waiting for the presidential assent to become law.
The Senate noted while passing the Bill that the emerging commission is expected to create a multi-modal transport system that will drive the nation’s transport policy and engender speedy economic development.
National Daily recalls that the passed Bill was read for the second time on the floor of the Senate on October 7, 2015, leading to the referral to the Joint Senate Committee on Land Transport, Marine Transport and Aviation Transport chaired by Senator Gbenga Ashafa, representing Lagos East Senatorial District.
In a statement shortly after passing the Commission Bill, elated Senator Ashafa issued a statement, saying “The National Transport Commission when signed into law is capable of setting the transport sector on the path of positive development. With this bill, we would successfully create a multi-modal transport sector for economic and safety oversight regulator of the sector. This is very good for business as it brings standard and structure to the transport sector while also increasing the revenue of government.”
“The Joint Senate Committee worked with the understanding that this is one of the priority economic bills of the 8th Senate and therefore ensured that all input from stakeholders were considered and the best possible version of the bill was presented to the Senate,” Senator Ashafa said.
