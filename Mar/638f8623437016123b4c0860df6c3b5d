As the wind of Change continues to blow over the NFF Elections scheduled for September this year in Katsina state, embattled NFF president Amaju Pinnick has returned to his vomit by going to Port Harcourt to beg barrister Chris Green for forgiveness.
Amaju who had earlier begged another board member Otunba Sunday Dele Ajayi (the Ondo state FA Chairman) flew to Port Harcourt on February 27 from Abuja after inaugurating Audit committee and Technical Study Group to beg barrister Green to cease fire and let them become friends again.
Our investigation confirmed that the embattled NFF president whose divide and rule policy sidelined barrister Green, Otumba Dele Ajayi and several others from the South and few from the North whom he has always boasted that he will win without them went begging them after the confrontation with management staff of the federation in Morocco.
We gathered authoritatively that the aggrieved staff had told him the home truth that he will be disappointed on the day of election and as a result, he resolved to make peace with the board members.
Efforts to reach barrister Green proved abortive but a very close ally who spoke with us on anonymity confirmed that there was a meeting between Amaju and Green, however, he was not in the picture.
He said even as he does not have the mandate of barrister Green to speak on the issue, he does not see the possibility of barrister Green and Amaju working together again.
Our source wondered how somebody who is holding a snake on its neck would leave it and noted that if somebody does that the snake would end up biting that person.
Meanwhile, Amaju has not relented in his bid to win barrister Green and other estranged board members back as he returned to Port Harcourt on Monday to see how he could make a head way by involving the governor, but informed sources disclosed that the embittered barrister could not bulge.
It could be recalled that the cold war between Amaju and two board members on one side and Green and other board members on the other side got to its apex with the former removing the later as technical committee chairman in standing committees reshuffle.
