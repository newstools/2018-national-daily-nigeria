The World Health organization in a report says it has received 1,500 reports on substandard and falsified products since 2013 with 42% of the reports coming from Africa, a proportion equal to the reports coming from Asia and Europe combined.

According to the report, antimalarial and antibiotics were the most reported with an estimated one in 10 medical products circulating in low- and middle-income countries either substandard or falsified.

The figure is suspected to be like more, with many cases going unreported. A combined 16% of the reports came from the Western Pacific, the Eastern Mediterranean and South East Asia regions.

“Many of these products, like antibiotics, are vital for people’s survival and wellbeing,” says Dr Mariângela Simão, Assistant Director-General for Access to Medicines, Vaccines and Pharmaceuticals at WHO.

“Substandard or falsified medicines not only have a tragic impact on individual patients and their families, but also are a threat to antimicrobial resistance, adding to the worrying trend of medicines losing their power to treat.”

“The costs of poor-quality medicines span well beyond individual deaths and illness,” says Ronald Piervincenzi, chief executive at the non-profit USP.

“Substandard and falsified medicines contribute to the growing and costly threat of anti-microbial resistance that could cause 10 million deaths by 2050 and cost the world up to $100 trillion.”

This is the first report since 2013, when the WHO began gathering data for a global surveillance and monitoring system.

Alongside the report, a separate research shows nearly 11% of all medical products used in low- and middle-income countries fail.

The study was based on more than 100 published research papers on medicine quality surveys done in 88 low- and middle-income countries involving 48,000 samples of medicines.
