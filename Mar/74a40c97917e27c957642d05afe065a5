Antoine Griezmann wants his future sorted before this summer’s World Cup in Russia.

The Atletico Madrid marksman was strongly linked with Manchester United last year, but a move to Old Trafford never materlialised.

Griezmann eventually penned a new long-term deal with Atletico as the La Liga outfit attempted to fend off interest in their star man.

However, the Frenchman continues to be linked with a switch to United, while Barcelona are believed to be keen on taking him to the Nou Camp.


The Catalans are believed to be in pole position for his signature after United snapped up Alexis Sanchez in January.

However, Griezmann doesn’t want talk over his future to continue heading into the World Cup later this year.

He told L’Equipe: “I want to travel to Russia without this concern.

“It’s not about knowing where I’ll play, but about having the peace of mind if I’m still in one place or another.

“It may be boring, but I have told my sister that, whether I stay or not, this will have to be resolved beforehand [prior to the World Cup].
