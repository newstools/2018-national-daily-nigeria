Former Chelsea striker, Didier Drogba, has said that Diego Maradona and Pele are better than Lionel Messi.

Drogba hailed Messi as an “extraordinary player”, but insists he’s not quite at the level of two legends just yet.

Messi has won the Ballon d’Or five times, the Champions League four times, and tasted La Liga success eight times, but so far World Cup glory has eluded him.

Drogba feels if he is able to achieve this, then he can be mentioned in the same sentence as his compatriot Maradona and Pele

“Messi could stop now and he would already have done a lot for football.

“To win a World Cup would make him even more legendary. He’s an extraordinary player!”

“He’s still not at the heights of Maradona and Pele, but he’s not far away,” Drogba told Sport.
