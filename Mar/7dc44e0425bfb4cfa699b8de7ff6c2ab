The Conference of Nigeria Political Parties (CNPP) has eulogised the National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) , Prince Uche Secondus, “for not only initiating the party’s dialogue with the people tagged “Nation Building: Resetting the Agenda”, but also for being humble enough to apologise to the people of Nigeria for the mistakes of the past.”
CNPP Secretary General, Chief Willy Ezugwu, in a statement on Monday acknowledged that “the PDP as a member of the CNPP has shown ‎maturity worthy of emulation.”
The Coalition declared: “The National Chairman of the PDP in his characteristic and sincere leadership style has led his party in an open confession of their sins and the party is entitled to be forgiven by Nigerians if we are sincere people.
“With the confession and pledge of its readiness to learn from its past mistakes arising from what the party failed to do, the PDP leader has rekindled hope in the ability of opposition political parties to provide alternative political platforms to better the lives of the now impoverished Nigerians, who are suffering due poor leadership.
“We, Therefore, urge Nigerians never to lose hope in the future we all desire for the country as together we shall all build a country we shall be proud of.”
The PDP had earlier in the day apologized to the Nigerian people for the past mistakes of the party in power for 16, promising to redeem the country from the bad governance of the All Progressives Congress (APC).
