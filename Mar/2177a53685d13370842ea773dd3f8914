Members of the Boko Haram sect are said to be on their way to Dapchi in Yobe state, to return Leah Sharibu, the kidnapped student in Dapchi who refused to convert to Islam.
 
According to a reliable source in the town, the Islamic insurgents are under pressure to release the girl. “As of 3pm, we heard that they were 20 kilometres from Dapchi,” a resident who does not want his identity revealed, said.

National Daily gathered that while some are rejoicing over the development, many have fled the town out of fear. “The news that they are bringing back the girl was received with mixed feelings,” another source said.

“Some people are jubilating but many have abandoned their homes out of fear. There is confusion as I speak to you. What if they decide to abduct more people? Those guys are lunatics.”

Sharibu is the only one in captivity out of the 110 students abducted on February 19.
Boko Haram had refused to release her because she rejected the option of renouncing her faith.

Expressing delight over her stance, the girl’s father prayed for her safe return.
Enoch Adeboye, general overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, also on Saturday prayed for release.
 
Many groups, including the Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC), had asked the federal government to negotiate her release.
 
President Muhammad Buhari had said his government would not abandon her.
