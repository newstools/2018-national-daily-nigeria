Leaders of the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP) have refuted a publication signaling an attack of Chibuike Amaechi, Minister of Transport, by the group. They described the statement as mere fabrication to unnecessarily insult the minster.
Fegalo Nsuke, Publicity Secretary, Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP), in a statement in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, protested that, “The attention of the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP) had been drawn to a publication titled: MOSOP ELDERS FLAYS UNFAIR POWER STANCE OF RT. HON. CHIBUIKE AMAECHI;” adding that the statement was signed by Bari-ara Kpalap.
He declared: “MOSOP wants to alert the general public of the dubious intention of this publication.
“We categorically state that the said statement is irresponsible and fraudulent especially as there is no such thing as an “Elders Council” within the structure and organisation of MOSOP.”
He maintained that whilst they remain committed to the protection of Ogoni interests, particularly, the political representation of the Ogoni people in certain key political offices such as the Governorship position of Rivers State, they take serious exception to people creating illegal platforms to misrepresent and exploit the painful conditions of the Ogoni people.
“We urge the general public to discountenance the statement in question as it does not emanate from MOSOP, its affiliates or organs and as such has nothing to do with MOSOP,” he said.
