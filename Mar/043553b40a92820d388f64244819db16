A 34-year-old man, Maaruf Sarki, has been arrested by the police in Niger State for killing his landlord, Tasiu Shittu in Kontagora area of the state.

Maaruf was also alleged to have buried his landlord in a shallow grave.

The Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) of the state police command, ASP Mohammed Abubakar, stated this yesterday in Minna, pointing out that Sarki also stole N1.7 million from the deceased including an unregistered Honda car.

He added that the suspect fled to Sokoto after committing the crime but was arrested by detectives from his hideout.

The police spokesman, who paraded Sarki along with 11 other suspects, which include kidnappers and robbers, said Sarki killed and buried one Alhaji Tasiu Shittu in shallow grave inside a rented apartment in Kontagora.

He explained that the apartment was rented out to the suspect by the deceased, adding that the suspect has led detectives to the shallow grave and that the body has been exhumed for autopsy.

Sarki said he was hired to kill his landlord by a business associate at the cost of N2 million, adding that he administered local herbs to poison his victim. “I used local medicine to kill the man and buried him inside the house, which I rented from him. I was hired to kill him by one of his business associates. I regret the action.”

However, the business associate is said to be on the run.
