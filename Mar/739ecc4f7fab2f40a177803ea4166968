The Main
‘The Eve’ is a romantic comedy produced by Cut24 productions, a new movie production company that’s fast making a name for itself with credits including some fantastic movies like Gidi Blues nd 4th Estate. ‘The Eve’ is scheduled to hit cinemas nationwide on March 30th 2018, while a Lagos premiere is planned for tomorrow March 24th at the Day Dream Pool Club, Landmark Towers, Victoria Island.
Who’s in it?
The Eve boasts of an impressive star-studded cast. Already one of Nollywood’s biggest stars, Beverly Naya stars in The Eve as the bride Yewande looking to marry her longtime heartthrob Funso Oni. She appears alongside Adeolu Adefarasin who plays the shy, easygoing Funso oni, delectable Meg Otanwa is Alero, the lady at the centre of the whole confusion in the movie. The movie also features John Okafor popularly known as Mr Ibu, Kunle Remi, Mawuli Gavor, Ronke Oshodi Oke, Ronke Odusanya, Uche Nwaefuna and other stars.
What’s the story?
The Eve tells a story of a young couple Funsho Oni (Adeolu Adefarasin) and Yewande (Beverly Naya) whose lives change forever barely 24 hours to their wedding following a series of events. There is definitely more that makes ‘The Eve’ a must-see movie, but what’s the joy of letting the cat out of the bag and denying you that beautiful cinematic experience that the movie provides. The Eve is produced by Hauwa Allahbura and directed by rapper turned movie director, Tosin Igho.
