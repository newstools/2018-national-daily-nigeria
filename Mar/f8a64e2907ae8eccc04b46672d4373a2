President Muhammadu Buhari has congratulated the General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), Pastor Enoch Adeboye (Daddy G.O), as he turns 76 on March 2.
In a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, on Thursday, the President extended warm felicitations to the family and friends of the highly revered preacher.
President Buhari noted that the clergyman is a teacher of the word of God under whose leadership, since 1981, the church has grown to become one of the largest congregations in the world, with parishes in almost all countries.
He also affirmed that the exemplary leadership provided by the servant of God has resulted in an exponential growth of the church, which directly translates into the development of infrastructure, building of educational and health institutions, as well as vocational centres that have created a means of livelihood for many Nigerians.
The President commended Pastor Adeboye’s warmth and friendliness, recalling his visits to the State House, and most significantly, the historic visit in London when he was on medical vacation.
He believes the clergyman has planted seeds of the gospel that posterity would always remember, especially his divinely inspired dream of ensuring that there will be a church within every walking distance in the country.
President Buhari further extolled Pastor Adeboye for his humility, focus, discipline and sacrificial spirit of giving up his personal comfort, career, and dreams, to take up the higher call of leading the Lord’s flock praying that the Almighty God will grant the church leader longer life, good health, and more strength to propagate the word of God.
