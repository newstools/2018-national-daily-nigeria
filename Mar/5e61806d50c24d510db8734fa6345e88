On March 13, Mr. Buhari announced the establishment of Council at a meeting with Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria, Rice Millers Association and Rice Distributors.

Others at the meeting were the CBN Governor, Godwin Emefiele, and the governors of Jigawa, Abubakar Badaru and Kebbi, Atiku Bagudu.

The Council is expected to appraise the impact of the issues on farmland; grazing areas and lakes, rivers and other water bodies; oil spillage and its impact on Niger Delta fishing communities, agricultural research institutions and extension services.

It will also take interest in regional and global policies and trends that bear implications for food security in Nigeria as well as address the problem of smuggling, piracy and banditry
