Another set of 26 victims murdered by suspected Fulani herdsmen were given mass burial today in Ugwu-Okpoga in Okpokwu local government area of Benue state.

Speaking at the funeral service held at St. Bernard Primary School Ugwu-Okpoga in Okpokwu local government area (LGA), Samuel Ortom, governor of the state, said the activities of “killer herdsmen” have led to too much blood shed in the state.
Ortom called on security agencies to arrest the leadership of Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore.

He also said there was no going back on the Open Grazing Prohibition and Ranches Establishment law.

Ortom assured Benue people that his administration would continue to respond swiftly to security challenges.
In a sermon, Akpena Leva, a reverend and chairman of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) in Benue, spoke on the need for security.
 
He also asked God to grant the governor and the people the strength to bear the loss.
The service was supposed to hold last week but the government postponed it because of the visit of President Muhammadu Buhari.
 
On January 11, Benue held a mass burial for the 73 persons killed in clashes between farmers and herdsmen.
