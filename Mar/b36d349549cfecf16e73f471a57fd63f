President Muhammadu Buhari says the government is ready to accept Boko Haram members who are willing to lay down their arms “unconditionally”.

The president said this on Friday when he received the 105 Dapchi schoolgirls recently released from Boko Haram custody.
The girls — abducted on February 19 — were released by the insurgents on Wednesday.

“While further efforts are being made to secure the release of every abducted citizen in Nigeria, government is ever ready to accept the unconditional laying down of arms by any member of the Boko Haram group, who show strong commitment in that regard,” he said.

“We are ready to rehabilitate and integrate such repentant members into the larger society. This country has suffered enough of hostility. Government is therefore appealing to all to embrace peace for the overall development of our people and the country.”

He added that government remains determined to bring back the Chibok schoolgirls in the insurgents’ custody.

“While parents of the Dapchi girls rejoice because of the reunion with their children, I want to appeal to the Chibok community never to lose hope or to despair,” Buhari said.
