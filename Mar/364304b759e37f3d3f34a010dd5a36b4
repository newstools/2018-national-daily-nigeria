Imo Governor Rochas Okorocha has emphasised a divine intervention in the endorsement of his son-in-law as APC‘s next governorship candidate in in 2019.

According to him, God and 24 out of the 27 local government areas in the state have ratified the ambition of his son-in-law to succeed him in office.

He stated this in Sunday while dismissing the rumour that his son-in-law and Chief if Staff Uche Nwosu supervised an assault on Owerri Catholic Archbishop A.J. V. Obinna.

The incident allegedly happened during a burial service on Saturday in Owerri North Local Government Area of the state.

In a statement issued by his Chief Press Secretary, Sam Onwuemeodo in Owerri, the governor said the news was a “blackmail being orchestrated by the opposition.”

He said the opposition has seen his son-in-law as the aspirant to beat in the race to the State House, and now uses the church against the ambition.

“That is the reason such a quintessential gentleman and an embodiment of decency should be associated with whatever that transpired at the event in question.”

Beside the sweeping endorsement Nwosu has got, the APC leaders in the state have also been urging the governor to do his best to put his son-law the succession race.
