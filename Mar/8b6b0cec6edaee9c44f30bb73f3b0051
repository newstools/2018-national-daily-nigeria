Muscle fatigue in his hamstrings and the adductor is likely to rule Lionel Messi out of playing against Spain on Tuesday night.

Despite having completed two training sessions on Sunday and Monday without a problem, the issues flared up again on Monday night.

Though he will be given until the last possible moment to prove his fitness, it may be wise for the player to have total rest, given the important club fixtures he has on the horizon.

Sampaoli and his coaching staff will not make the final decision and everything will depend on how the Argentine feels throughout the day.

In any case, what is clear is that Messi won’t complete the match at the Estadio Wanda Metropolitano.

The problems already prevented him from playing the friendly against Italy, however, it was Messi’s intention to start against La Roja.

“My idea is to play against Spain,” he said to Fox Sports on Monday afternoon.

“I was left with the choice to play against Italy and didn’t, but I trained normally, I felt good, so I hope to play.”
