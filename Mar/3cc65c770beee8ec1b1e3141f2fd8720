Says it’s call for anarchy




The Minister of Defence, Mansur Dan-Ali, has decried the statement by former Defence Minister, T.Y. Danjuma, who on Saturday advocated self-defense and seeming loss of confidence on the Nigerian Army.
Dan Ali in a statement on Saturday night lamented:  “This is highly uncalled for and is invitation to anarchy and should be disregarded by well-meaning Nigerians.”
Colonel Tukur Gusau, media aide to the Minister of Defence, Mansur Dan-Ali, in the statement narrated that,  “The efforts of the Nigerian military towards restoration of peace, security and order in Nigeria are evidently clear and Nigerians continue to show appreciation for changing the security environment from what it was before.”
The minster articulated:  “The armed forces are well organised and highly professional in discharging its constitutional mandate.
“Therefore, if anyone has evidence of wrongdoing or dereliction of duty against our troops (the person) should please bring forward such evidence through the channel for necessary action.”
He insisted the military will “not be distracted” by such comments.
