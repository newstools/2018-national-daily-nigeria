Real Madrid manager, Zinedine Zidane, has praised Cristiano Ronaldo’s “unique ambition” after his four-goal haul in Sunday’s 6-3 LaLiga win at home to Girona.

Ronaldo had scored just one domestic league goal by mid-November, but now has 22 – three behind Barcelona’s Lionel Messi in the race for the “Pichichi” top scorer prize.

Speaking after the game, Zidane said the 33-year-old’s “positive energy” was good for him personally, but also rubbed off on his teammates.

“[Ronaldo] is very important for us. He transmits a very important, very positive energy for the rest of the group.

“On a personal level he has 22 goals, three behind Messi, so I hope [that goes well] for him, as when he is good, the team is good.

“He knows himself very well, knows when he must rest a bit, and when the end of the season arrives he is always very good. He scores goals, and always will.

“His ambition is tremendous, in every training game, every play, which makes him different from everyone else,” Zidane said.
