Kaduna Electricity Distribution Company said it had lost 10 transformers and equipment worth millions of naira to vandals within the last three months in Kaduna metropolis.
The power distribution company said in a statement, signed by Abdul-Aziz Abdullahi that the activities of vandals had continued to cause “untold hardship to customers and colossal revenue loss to the company.’’
“In the first three months of this year alone, the Company in its Rigasa Area office has lost equipment worth millions of naira in about 10 incidents of vandalism of power supply assets belonging to the Company.”
It said the development was “a serious set-back to the company’s effort at providing steady and qualitative power supply to the customers.’’
The company, therefore, appealed community leaders and other stakeholders to contribute in the fight against vandalism of power supply installations in their areas.
It said that the vandalised facilities were located at Chawai and Chanchangi sub-stations in Tudun wada, Musabaka sub-station in Kinkinau, Sani Malunfashi sub-station in Kurmin Mashi, Zamfara and Kangiwa sub-stations in Rigasa.
Also affected were the National Eye Centre sub-station in Mahuta, and the electricity armoured cable on Leventis feeder by Central Bank of Nigeria, all in Kaduna.
The company, therefore, advised customers to protect the installations and pay their bills prompt to guarantee effective service delivery.
