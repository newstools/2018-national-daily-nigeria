The Ogun Command of Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) has advised motorists in the state to emulate Jesus Christ as they celebrate the Easter period.
Mr Clement Oladele, the Sector Commander of FRSC, gave the advice in an interview with newsmen in Ota, Ogun.
According to him, the Easter is about the death and resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ.
“Because Jesus Christ loves the world, he sacrificed his life so that human beings could find redemption.
“In the same light, when a motorists does not have love for other road users, he/she will not respect and tolerate them when they make mistakes on the highways.
 “If a motorists does not love, he/she cannot respect the rules and regulations guarding the safety of the highways.
“If motorists do not have love for one another, they will not obey traffic officials that are labouring day and night, who have abandoned their families to ensure that people get to their destinations safely,” he said.
Oladele said that if motorists could emulate the love, kindness, tolerance and humility of Jesus Christ and apply it to the rules of the highways, it would reduce crashes and save more lives and property on our roads.
