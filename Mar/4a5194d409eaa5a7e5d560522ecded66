The House of Representatives has resolved strip Solid Mimereals Minster Kayode Fayemi following the vote of no confidence passed by the House on the minister.
The lawmakers believe that passing a vote of no confidence in a minister is enough grounds for the president to sack him.
They also observed that Fayemi’s decision to engage PricewaterhouseCoopers, a “globally discredited” firm, to conduct a technical audit on Ajaokuta Steel Company, revealed that he was bent on concessioning the firm.
The lower chamber then proposed to amend the Privatisation Act immediately by weeding out the ASC from the list of public assets in the schedule that can be privatised or concessioned by the Federal Government.
It also planned to remove removing the powers of the National Council on Privatisation as the authority to decide on which firms should be on the schedule.
Fayemi and the federal lawmakers last week traded word when he was given a vote of no confidence.
