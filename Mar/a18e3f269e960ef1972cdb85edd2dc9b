The senate has confirmed five nominees of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).
The refusal of the upper legislative chamber to confirm the nominees had stalled the meeting of the apex bank in January and March.

The lawmakers had said the only condition to confirm nominees of President Muhammadu Buhari is for the federal government to sack Ibrahim Magu, acting chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) in line with their recommendation

The nominees are Prof. Adeola Adenikinju, Dr Aliyu Sanusi, Dr Robert Asogwa and Dr Asheikh Maidugu.

The Senate also considered Buhari’s request that Mrs. Aisha Ahmad and Mr. Edward Adamu be confirmed as CBN Deputy Governors.

Moving for the adoption of the request, the Senate Leader, Sen. Ahmed Lawan said that the process was in accordance with the provisions of Section 12 (1)(4) of the CBN Act 2007.
