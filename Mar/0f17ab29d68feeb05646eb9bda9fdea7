Olivier Giroud has only been at Chelsea since the end of January but the former Arsenal striker already feels very settled at Stamford Bridge.

The Frenchman has scored just once in his first eight appearances for the Blues, although he’s yet to complete a full match.

Giroud, who has also chipped in with three assists, is really enjoying playing alongside attacking midfield players like Eden Hazard, Willian and Pedro.

‘I am very happy about how I’ve adapted to Chelsea,’ said Giroud. ‘I’ve been very welcomed there.

‘I feel great and have a special relationship with the No 10, playing behind the front striker whether it is Eden, Willian or Pedro. I felt great right from my first game. I was decisive.

‘It’s true that the games that followed were a bit harder and I didn’t manage to score goals. It was a mix between a lack of efficiency or maybe a lack of clear chances, for example, against [Crystal] Palace.

‘But it’s very promising, and you’ve got to remember that it’s not easy changing teams in the winter transfer window, and then to quickly adapt to a new team. But it was my choice and I don’t hide behind anything.

‘I just work hard every day in training in order to be efficient as soon as possible, and reach our objectives, as we have an exciting end to the season coming up.’
