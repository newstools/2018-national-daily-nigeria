The Lagos State government has soft pedal on the implementation of the new Lagos State Land Use Charges, promising a review downward in the controversial law.
In a tweet posted on its official Twitter handle, the Lagos state government announced a reduction in recently amended Land Use Charges.
Governor Akinwunmi Ambode had earlier hinted at the willingness of the state government to modify the charges. He made this known during a parley with business leaders in the state.
The revised Land Use Charge had been a source of controversy as many residents had viewed the charge as exorbitant. In some cases, increases were as much as 400%.
The state government had justified steep increase as due to the non-revision of the law in over a decade and the need to increase revenue.
Lagosians also kicked against the inclusion of a private firm Alpha Beta to monitor the collection of the charges. The Lagos State House of Assembly has since stated the inclusion was an error.
