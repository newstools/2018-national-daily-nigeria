A traditional ruler and his wife have been killed by attackers suspected to be herdsmen who invaded Agbenema, Aj’Lchekpa, Opada, and Iyade in Kogi on Monday.

No fewer than ten other also died while several houses were burnt down.

The attackers were said to be armed with sophisticated weapons.

Their attack combined arson with shooting the victims, and slitting the throat and vital parts of those fleeing caught alive.

Omala LGA administrator, Ibrahim Aboh, was one of those lucky to escape from attack.
Also, the houses of former chairman, Adofu Stephen; and that of his parents were burnt.

Residents said  soldiers deployed to contain the herdsmen’s violence allegedly refused to
assist .

“They refused to act professionally, as they used their vehicle to block us from advancing to the troubled spot to help our people.

“We want the world to come to our assistance before they exterminate and inherit our land,” they said.

No official response from the police yet.

It beggars belief that the Confluence state, which was among the first states to welcome the cattle colony scheme of the federal government, is now a hotbed of violence by the herdsmen.

James Faleke, a former senator and guber contestant in the state, blamed Gov Bello Yahaya for opening Kogi’s door for attackers in the name of cattle colony.
