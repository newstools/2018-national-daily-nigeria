A girl reportedly drank Sniper insecticide she got from her mother’s shop, and died after discovering she failed JAMB examination.
Loveth, 18, lived in Ughelli, Delta, went to check her result Tuesday, and found out she scored 160–a point below the cut-off mark for her choice.
 
She thereafter began to crym saying her father would kill her, thoughm sources later said, the father simply told her she would not be able to get admission to study medicine with that score.
 It was gathered that Loveth brought the insecticide home, drank it overnight.
Her remains were found Wednesday morning.
But the parents decided to take her to a Pentecostal church at Upper Agbarho for prayers.
No official comment yet from the state police command.
This was the second incident where frustrated people in the state decided to take Sniper to end it all.

It also marked the first incident of JAMB candidate suicide in years.
