President Muhammadu Buhari on Thursday joined well-meaning Nigerians in wishing Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo a happy 61st birthday.
On his Twitter handle, @MBuhari, the president thanked Osinbajo for being a loyal and dependable partner.
 “Happy 61st Birthday, @ProfOsinbajo. Thank you for being a loyal and dependable partner on this journey,” Buhari wrote.
“I join millions of your friends and well-wishers around the world to wish you many more years of service to God, to Nigeria, and to humanity.”
In the fragmented ruling APC, many would have expected the VP to have been most loyal to his godfather and party’s national leader Bola Tinubu.

Many tribal jingoists in the southwest region may have expected Osinbajo not to have sold out to the north by being loyal to a northern president.
The Presidency, via @NGRPresident, also posted a photograph of the President, currently on a two-day official visit to Plateau State, congratulating Osinbajo on the telephone.
“President @MBuhari wishing Vice President @ProfOsinbajo a Happy Birthday from Jos, Plateau State, earlier today,”the caption reads.
But this was not the first time Buharo would openly extol Osinbajo for his loyalty and dependability.
The VP at various time has also said he takes Buhari as his father.
