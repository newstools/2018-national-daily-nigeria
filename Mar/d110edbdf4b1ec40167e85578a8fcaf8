U.S Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has revealed the place Nigeria occupies in the North American country’s foreign policy, and how it is ready to help Nigeria through its trying times.
Tillerson told President Muhammadu Buhari during his visit to Abuja on Monday.
Receiving Tillerson, Buhari thanked the US for its military assistance.
He noted that Nigeria is working in concert with international organizations and negotiators, to ensure that the recently kidnapped girls are released unharmed by their captors.
He said Nigeria prefers to have schoolgirls abducted by Boko Haram from Chibok and Dapchi back alive, and that is why it has chosen negotiation, rather than military option.
“We are trying to be careful. It is better to get our daughters back alive,” Buhari said.
He said that Nigerian forces are good, “but need assistance in the areas of training and equipment.”
President Buhari promised that his administration would continue to do its best to secure the country, adding that he would be in Yobe State, from where Dapchi schoolgirls were abducted, later this week “as part of my condolence and sympathy visits to areas where we have had unfortunate events.”
The President pledged free and fair polls in 2019.
He recalled that the then American Secretary of State, John Kerry, had visited before the 2015 polls, “and he told the party in government then, and those of us in opposition, to behave ourselves, and we did.”
Tillerson commended President Buhari on his strides in the anti-corruption war, to which the Nigerian leader responded that moneys recovered are being invested on development of infrastructure.
“You have our support in your challenges. We will also support opportunities to expand the economy, commercial investments, and peaceful polls in 2019.”
