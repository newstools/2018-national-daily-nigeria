The Senate has finally approved that the nominees for the positions of CBN’s  deputy governor and members of the Monetary Policy Committee be screened for confirmation.
Chairman of the Senate Committee on Banking, Insurance and Other Financial Institutions Senator Rafiu Ibrahim raises a point of order at the plenary on Tuesday.
He urged the lawmakers to lift their embargo on confirmation of appointments by President Muhammadu Buhari.
According to him, the  non-confirmation of the deputy governors of the CBN and members of the MPC was negatively affecting the economy, especially foreign investments.
The lawmakers unanimously granted the prayer.
Other nominations the upper chamber has refused to consider include that of the EFCC chairman Ibrahim Magu and some electoral commissioners Buhari forwarded last year.
The House has also decided to over-ride Buhari’s decision not to assent to the Peace Corps Bill.
Just in Tuesday, the president also withheld assent from the electoral amendment bill.
