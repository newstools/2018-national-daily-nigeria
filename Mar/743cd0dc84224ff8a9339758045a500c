The Minister of Finance, Mrs. Kemi Adeosun, has clarified the letter to the acting Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Mr. Ibrahim Magu, on cash recoveries by the Federal Government which has been widely misinterpreted in the social media
Accordingly, the Minister, on Sunday, stated explicitly that the letter dated 9th February, 2018, was a standard letter aimed at improving controls over the recovered funds. She explained that the communication was a routine practice in the public service for proper record keeping on the recovered funds in the anti-corruption war in the country. She added that eh response is already helping in reconciliation and harmonization of the recovered funds.
“There is no ulterior motive behind the letter as alleged in some media reports but to enable the reconciliation and harmonisation of the figures on recovered funds by the Government.
“For the avoidance of doubt, the EFCC has subsequently provided the requested information and reconciliation is ongoing.”
