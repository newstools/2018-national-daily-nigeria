Hillary Clinton has broken her wrist, and ricked her ankle in series of accidents since she began her visit to India.
The former Secretary of State injured her right hand on Tuesday, after slipping in a bathtub at the palace where she was staying in Jodhpur.
Doctors were called to the Umaid Bhawan Palace and diagnosed the 70-year-old with a sprain, advising her to rest which forced her to cancel plans to visit the Mehrangarh Fort that evening.
But the pain only worsened, and by Wednesday morning she decided to get her hand checked out at Goyal Hospital.
Doctors there administered a CT Scan and an X-ray of Clinton’s wrist, and determined that she had a hairline fracture, according to the Times of India.
Hillary Clinton’s wrist injury was worse than thought.
Doctors now say she fractured her wrist after slipping in a bathtub at an Indian palace where she was staying on Tuesday.
Clinton is arrived in Jodhpur on Tuesday, just before the fall
They wrapped her wrist in a crepe bandage and advised her to rest further, and get a follow up in three days with doctors wherever she was staying.
Her doctors back in the U.S. agreed.
Clinton then cancelled the rest of her plans for the day, which included traveling to a village outside the city to see workers weave carpets.
It meant that Clinton didn’t get to do any of her planned itinerary in Jodhpur, as she was scheduled to leave for the next stop of her trip, Jaipur, on a chartered plane Thursday morning, according to DNA India
This is the second time that Clinton has fallen on her tour of India.
While visiting the ancient city of Mandu in Madhya Pradesh, the former first lady was filmed falling down the stairs Jahaz Mahal, of a 13th century harem.
It’s unclear whether that fall contributed to Clinton’s injury, as she did use her right hand to catch herself on the stairs.
The injury comes just five months after she broke her toe in a fall in London.
