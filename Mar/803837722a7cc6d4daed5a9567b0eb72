The Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Dr. Ibe Kachikwu has refuted the speculations that he intends to contest for Delta State Governor in 2019.
The minister was gathered to have said that the speculation is the handiwork of idle minds, debunking that he has no ambition to be governor of Delta State, dismissing the speculation as “non-edifying cheap gossip”.
The minister was cited to have declared:  “I have refuted this story time and time again, and for the umpteenth time, I want to place it on the record that stories about my governorship bid are sponsored to achieve whatever result. But the truth is that such stories have nothing to do with me as a person and even curious is that the peddlers are very consistent, meaning it is a calculated falsehood being sold to the public.
“I might not have a grasp of why they are doing this, it is not totally true, however, that I do not have a clue why they are traveling this route. Unfortunately, it is cheap and undeserving of my precious time. That I am denying it again does not mean in another one month or two, they would still not dust the story up again, modulate and spin it from yet another angle.
“What this means is that those behind the stories are not just idle, they are clearly people of small minds, who have nothing productive and engaging to do but have elected to be canon fodders in the hands of equally feeble minds to fester whatever sinister plans they have.
But trust me, I am not bothered and this is not in any way a concern.”
Some people in August 2017, came up with the rumour that Kachikwu had ambition to contest elections in 2019. The minister was linked with plot to unseat incumbent Governor Ifeanyi Okowa in the 2019 governorship election in Delta State.
