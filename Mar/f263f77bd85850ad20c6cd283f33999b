The archbishop of Owerri Catholic archdiocese reportedly assaulted by some APC members Saturday has accepted his suffering as that of Jesus on the cross.

Archbishop Valentine Obinna said he had left in God’s hand.

The APC members accompanying the wife of the state governor, Nkechi Okorocha, the chief of staff to the governor, Uche Nwosu, and the Speaker of the state House of Assembly, Acho Ihim, and some commissioners were said to have invaded the altar and ordered the archbishop to stop his speech considered anti-state government.

The chief Judge of the state, Pascal Nnadi; and the senator representing Imo East, Samuel Anyanwu, were also present at the funeral service that ended in violence between the ruling APC and the PDP..

The APC members accused the prelate of allowing someone to campaign for the People’s Democratic Party during a speech, while he allegedly refused an APC member who wanted to do the same.

“APC members who came with the government functionaries invaded the altar and asked to be allowed to speak, and the bishop allegedly refused,” a source stated.

“This led to a protest, and some Reverend Fathers intervened and assisted the archbishop to complete his speech.”

“The archbishop and the archdiocese have decided to take no action against the APC members who assaulted the church,; the diocese media office said.

But the media aide to the chief of staff to the governor, who said he was at the church service, said the APC members were not to blame. Chikezie Nwadike said the PDP member campaigning in the church initiated the confusion, adding the archbishop was not assaulted by APC members.

The state has been boiling since Gov. Rochas Okorocha began the move to put forward his chief of staff and son-law to succeed him come next election.
