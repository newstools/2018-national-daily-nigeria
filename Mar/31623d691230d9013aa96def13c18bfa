He wrote:
“1: One of the richest men in the world, Bill Gates, was one of the most humble in his dressing.
“2: Money and power know no religion.
“3: The usual showbiz social butterflies and event whores, whored from their homes. (Mention one person who falls into this category).
“4: Those of from lesson (3) above, who managed to attend, where humbled and subdued, only managing to whimper on social media.
“5: There was segregation…. REAL money was successfully quarantined away from entertainment money.
“6: If this could be done successfully in Nigeria, why are some people running abroad?
“7: Dangote has sent wedding planners back to the drawing boards.
“8: All it took to slay a slay queen this weekend, was to show her an invite to this wedding.
“9: The bride and the groom were stunning… and despite the tremendous amount of wealth, both stayed #Humble #HappyPeople
“10: The party is over now…. get back to work… if you want to be like Bill Gates or Dangote and have a wedding like this for your children, tomorrow is Monday and a perfect place to start putting those dreams into perspective and those plans Into action. ~FRZ”
