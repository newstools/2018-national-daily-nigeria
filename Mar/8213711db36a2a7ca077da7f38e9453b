Super Eagles coach, Gernot Rohr, says the victory against Poland in Friday’s friendly is not a yardstick to rate his team as favourites in their 2018 World Cup group pairing.
While disclosing that the development would instil confidence in the players to prepare well for the tournament, Rohr added that the absence of captain Mikel Obi did not affect the team, but, rather gave the players the opportunity to exhibit leadership roles.
After the 1-0 win against Poland on Friday in Wroclaw, the Eagles will take on Serbia in another top friendly game in London on Tuesday, March 27, 2018.
