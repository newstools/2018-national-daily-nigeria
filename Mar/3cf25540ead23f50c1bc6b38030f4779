The Northern Governors Forum on Thursday said its members have never opposed President Muhammadu Buhari’s proposal on the cattle colony scheme to end communal 
clashes across the nation.

The governors, in a communiqué released in Thursday after their meeting in Kaduna, noted that with ranching, there would be significant improvement in the production of dairy products in the north.

Chairman of the NGF and Borno Governor Kashim Shettima said ranching would enhance the productivity of animals in the country.

“While a cow in other countries produces as much as 40 litres of milk per day, our own breed of cow produces only one litre,” said Shettima.

According to him, this was not even enough to sustain the ever growing population in the north and other parts of the country.

The forum also emphasised its support for Buhari’s to tackle herder-farmer clashes  in Nigeria.

The northern governors converged yesterday to discuss security and restructuring issues with respect to the region.
