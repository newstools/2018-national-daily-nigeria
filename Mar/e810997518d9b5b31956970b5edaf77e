In his response to why Nigerians still pay more to access household petroleum products, the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources and Board Chairman, Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Dr. Emmanuel Ibe Kachikwu,  said what the country needed now is to have its refineries working, noting that it makes better business sense to add value to crude oil than sell the commodity raw.
However, he was silent on why refineries failed to work after years of appropriation for their repairs.
Currently, the NNPC GMD, Dr. Maikanti Baru said the Corporation is scouting for investors willing to put down money (about $1.8bn) for the repairs of the refineries so as to end importation.
