Former Vice President of Nigeria and a presidential aspirant on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar, urges Nigerianl to ensure that they register and collect their Permanent Voters Cards (PVC) for the 2019 general elections.
Abubakar at a launch of a website for one of his support groups, Concerned Citizens For Atiku, Represented by the Chairman of All-Atiku Support Groups, Oladimeji Fabiyi, stated that technology will play a huge role in mobilizing the electorate in next year’s election.
The former vice president remarked that since elections are not conducted on the social media, “It is pertinent that you go out there and tell your family and friends to register and collect their PVC.”
Abubakar urged young Nigerians to participate more in politics and organise themselves for the purpose of taking over from the older generation of politicians.
 “I have said it before and I will reiterate it here that I am fully committed to the agenda of generational transfer of power to the youths of this country.
“I think it is important that your generation participates more in politics and organise yourselves,” Atiku declared.
The convener of the group, Adebowale Jante, thanked the former Vice President for honouring their invitation, adding that the group will join several other Nigerians to urge him to run for president in 2019.
