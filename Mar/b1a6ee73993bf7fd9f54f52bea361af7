The Edo chapter of the ruling APC has hailed President Muhammadu Buhari’s objection to tebure elongation as democratic.

Buhari on Tuesday said his view was informed by legal advice from AGF Abubakar Malami.

Reacting to the decision, the state chairman of the party said the initial decision by the party’s National Working Committee to extend National Chairman John Oyegun’s and
others’ tenure by a year is unconstitutional.

“What the President said is justified; that is democracy at work,’ said Anselm Ojezua.
Naturally, many had expected the Edo APC to have been the home turf of Oyegun, who comes from the state, in the fight to entrench his leadership of the party.

As things are now, the chairman has lost key allies in the tenure extension fight.

APC National Leader Bola Tinubu has always been against the NWC’s decision.

Oyegun now has Buhari, Tinubu, and state party on the other side.
