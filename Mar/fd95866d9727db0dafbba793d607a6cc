The decision by the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the All Progressives Congress (APC) to elongate the tenure of executive committees at all levels by one year has sparked off a crisis in the Ekiti State chapter of the party.
Checks by our correspondent showed that most governorship aspirants in the party are of the view that the decision is only favorable to former Governor Kayode Fayemi, who is currently the Minister of Solid Minerals.
Fayemi is among about 40 people jostling to be the party’s candidate in the July 14, 2018 poll.
The other aspirants hinged their displeasure on the fact that before Fayemi left office, having been defeated by Ayodele Fayose of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), he planted his surrogates across all levels of the party in the state.
Recall that when the APC was formed close to the 2014 governorship elections in Ekiti and Osun states, the national leaders of the party decided that all the executives in the party in the two states should continue in office.
Before the NEC’s decision of this week, some aspirants such as Senator Femi Ojudu, Bamidele Faparusi and others fought for the dissolution and reconstitution of the executive committees.
With the way things are, anytime the primary of the party is called, Fayemi would have an easy ride.
It was gathered that aggrieved aspirants are considering a number of possibilities.
Among them is contesting on the platforms of other parties if their grievances are not looked into.
