The Iguomon community in Uhunmwode Local Government Area of Edo State has been plagued by mysterious deaths and diseases after the Benin monarch placed curse on the community which leaders defied the Oba’s order.
It was gathered that former officials of the outlawed Community Development Association (CDA), had disobeyed orders from the Palace and perverted native norms and customs.
Indigenes of the community were said to have gathered before Oba Ewuare II in tears on Tuesday, begging His Royal Majesty for forgiveness and to revoke the curse on the community.
They were said to be lamenting that mysterious deaths, strange diseases, unusual afflictions have overtaken the community since the Monarch placed curse on the community.
The indigenes were said to have promised that they would carry out all traditional rites or rituals required to revoke the curse.
They were further gathered to have appealed to the Oba to recognize Roland Okhuarobo as the authentic Odionwere of Iguomon, promising not to involve in violation of traditional laws to eschew further mysterious deaths and disasters.
