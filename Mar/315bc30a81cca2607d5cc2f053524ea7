Oganienugwu, Ikende communities in Dekina Local Government Area, and Abejukolo, Omala LGA, Kogi, have been invaded by attackers suspected to be Fulani herdsmen, leaving no fewer than 25 people dead.
Villagers were reportedly moving out of Obakume, Idirisu, and Oji Apata in anticipation of more attacks.
Security operatives, including police and soldiers have been deployed to contain the violence which began Tuesday night, and lasted through Thursday.
Reports have it that the attackers, dressed in military uniform and armed with AK-47 rifles, were tying up the victims, before inflicting machete cuts on them. Gun shots were also used to stampede the villagers.
The victims were initially attacked on their farms, and by midnight, others in the villages were jolted out their sleep with gunshots, and fire.
Deputy Commissioner of Police Monday Bala confirmed the incident, but could not ascertain the body count yet.
Last week, the state government was under scrutiny by the Senate following allegations that Gov. Bello Yahyah, concerned about insecurity in the state, imported military gears for vigilante groups.
But the mayhem is coming less than a week after.
