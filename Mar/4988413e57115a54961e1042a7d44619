Super Eagles Media Officer Toyin Ibitoye has put to rest once and for all speculation in the media that Joel Obi, Oghenekaro Etebo and Tyronne Ebuehi will not be available for next week’s international friendly against Poland,National Daily gathered.
Ibitoye confirmed to National Daily that both Las Palmas and Ado Den Haag have not informed the Nigerian Federation about the injuries sustained by Etebo and Ebuehi, adding that the players are on the final stretch of the recovery process and will report for international duty next week.
As for Joel Obi, there is nothing new from Ibitoye, but the injury update from Torino is not positive, with the club informing on Thursday via their official website that the central midfielder had an individual training session ahead of Sunday’s visit of Fiorentina.
Obi’s appearances for the national team have been limited by physical problems but the midfielder has given his word that he will honour this latest invitation.
Tyronne Ebuehi was sighted exercising with his teammates on Thursday, however, he remains doubtful to suit up against Excelsior in the Eredivisie this evening.
Nigeria will face Poland on March 23 before flying to the English capital, where they will trade tackles with Serbia on March 27.
