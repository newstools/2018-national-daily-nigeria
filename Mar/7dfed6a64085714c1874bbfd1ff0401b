Obasanjo had in his statement advised Buhari not to seek re-election in 2019 bit retired to join the league of former presidents in the country. Thereafter, the former president tool his campaign to United States of America, now turning to the United Kingdom  top strengthen his campaign against the incumbent president; the same thing he did top former President Goodluck Jonathan.
Former President Obasanjo has continued to list the failures of President Buhari and the reasons why he should forego 2019. He maintained that Nigeria will not remain a corporate country if Buhari wins the presidential election in 2019.
