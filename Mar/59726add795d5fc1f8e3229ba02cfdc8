Kogi West Senator Dino Melaye has petitioned Inspector General of Police Ibrahim Idris, three rights bodies, the UN, and four countries to come to his rescue in the grip of his political adversary in Kogi.

Melaye alleged in the petition issued on Sunday that there is a plan to murder him “extra-judicially” by his “political enemies”working with men of the Kogi State Police Command.

The petitions were sent to the United Nations’ resident representative and the ambassadors of the United States, Germany, Canada, and the high commissioner of the United Kingdom in Nigeria.

The Amnesty International, Transparency International and the Human Rights Watch were also petitioned.

He filed the petitions through his lawyers, Messrs Ricky Tarfa & Co, urging the IGP to raise a neutral police team to investigate the allegations of gun-running the Kogi State Police Command brought against him.

He alleged there are “wilfull, intentional harassment, oppression, political victimisation and threat to life.”

According to him,  he lives each day in constant and reasonable fear for his life, and he is being harassed by certain politicians and police are a willing tools in the hands of these politicians.

“I am a law-abiding citizen who voluntarily submitted himself before the FCT High Court to answer charges which I know are unsustainable.

“I therefore seek your intervention in the circumstances to ensure that my fundamental human rights, which both Nigeria and your countries are party to, are guaranteed and my life protected,” he said.

The FCT Senate Committee chairman has got it up to his eyeball in recent times.

An appeal court just ordered him to go face a recall he fought for nine months in court.

There are also allegations of perjury and gun-running still pending against him.
