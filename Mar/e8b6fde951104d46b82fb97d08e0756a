President Muhammadu Buhari has given a tall order that might pit him against his security chiefs in case they miss the mark their commander-in-chief just gave: that no kidnapping should be reported anywhere in Nigeria again after the Dapchi schoolgirls’.
Buhari said he has directed all the security chiefs to beef up security around schools all over the nation so no pupil, student, teachers or school worker will fall victim to kidnapping again.
 “They have been warned in clear terms that any lapse on their parts will be viewed seriously,” he said at Aso Rock while addressing the 105 schoolgirls Boko Haram released on Wednesday.
Nigerian service chiefs include the COAS Tukur Buratai , Defence Chief Gen. Gabriel Olonisakin, IGP Ibrahim Idris, CNS iBOK Ekwe, CAS Sadiq Abubakar, and IGP Ibrahim Idris.
A report by the Daily Trust said no fewer than 600 people were kidnapped from May 2016 and May 2017. Of the eoght states with highest kidnapping rates, three of them are in the north.
Besides, the Nigerian military have been heavily involved in policing activities across the country, apart from the Boko Haram terrorism, the Niger Delta militancy, and the now abated IPOB secessionist crisis.
Buhari also warned those who he said were “politicising”security issues to make political fortunes.
 “Government would not tolerate any attempt by any person or group to trivialise or politicise security issues for politically motivated ends.
“Accordingly, security agencies would not hesitate to decisively deal with such unscrupulous characters,” he said.
