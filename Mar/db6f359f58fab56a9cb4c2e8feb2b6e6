The presidency has confirmed the release of many of the 110 Dapchi schoolgirls Boko Haram snatched Feb 19.
There are reports that 76 of the girls have so far been released.
But Aso Rock has yet to state categorically what the figures are.
 “Yes, the girls are being transported to safety. We will give details later. We thank God,” said Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity Garba Shehu on Wednesday.
There were conflicting official reports when the girls were kidnapped in February, especially those from Information Minister Lai Mohammed and the state government.
Many criticised this as a damage control measure gone awry.
Aso Rock may be holding its horses now so as to avoid another communication crisis.
Shehu promised to give more details later.
But the National Daily gathered the terrorists returned the girls to Dapchi in the same set of vehicles that ferried the girls away over a month ago.
Parents and sympathisers also have confirmed the release.
“The girls have been brought back. They were brought in nine vehicles and dropped outside the school at about8:00 am (0700 GMT),” Bashir Manzo, who heads a group set up to support parents whose children were abducted told the AFP.
Former Chairman of Chibok Community in Abuja Tsambido Abana also confirmed the release of the girls.
 “I just spoke with a Chibok parent who is in contact with the parents of the Dapchi girls. He said the parents confirmed the release of the girls but we don’t know if all of the girls were released or not, but we can confirm that Boko Haram has released some of the Dapchi girls,” Abana told the Punch.
The federal government said last week it was drawing close to securing the release of the girls.
