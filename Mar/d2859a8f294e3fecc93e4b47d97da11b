Some parents of the Chibok girls still in captivity visited former President Olusegun Obasanjo Saturday at his Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library, Abeokuta, Ogun, on Saturday.

No fewer than 30 of the parents arrived the venue in the morning to appeal to Obasanjo to intervene as misch as possible to help secure the release of their daughters, too.

The prompt release of over 100 Dapchi girls kidnapped about a month ago might have prompted to make the appeal.

The Chibok parents beloeve that Obasanjo, as a national and global influence, can help them speed things up for the freedom of their kidnapped daighters.

Boko Haram invaded the Government Girls Secondary School, Chibok, Borno, and kidnapped away 276 pupils on April 14, 2014.

Hundreds of the kidnapped girls have been released through negotiation and prisoner swaps since 2015.

Others are still held hostage, while some have decided to join the terrorists.
Some have died, too.
