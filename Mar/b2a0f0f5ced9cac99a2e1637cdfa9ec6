Several people were killed after a bridge collapsed at Florida International University in Miami on Thursday afternoon.
The bridge, located at 109th Ave and 8th Street, collapsed on a number of cars around 5.30pm (GMT).
Police confirmed that multiple people were killed but had not yet released a figure on fatalities.
At least eight people were taken away from the scene and eight vehicles were trapped in the bridge wreckage, Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez said.
Dramatic footage shows the collapsed bridge with a number of cars underneath it.
Witness Tiona Page told ABC News that she could hear screams coming from the cars.
She said: ‘As soon as I looked outside, I saw dust flying everywhere. I knew the bridge had collapsed.’
Other footage shows nurses and doctors rushing to the scene to try and treat the injured.
The new 950-tonne bridge was built next to the road and then rolled into place in one piece on Saturday, just west of 109th Avenue.
It is believed to be the largest bridge ever built this way in the US.
Construction of the bridge began in the spring of 2017 and was expected to be completed in early 2019.
The $11 million project was built with the aim of connecting the university with a nearby new housing development. University management previously praised the construction method claiming it was safer.
FIU President Mark B. Rosenberg said: ‘FIU is about building bridges and student safety. This project accomplishes our mission beautifully.’ Miami Dade Police said on Twitter: ‘MDPD is on the scene of a bridge collapse near FIU. Please avoid the area of Tamiami Trail and SW 107 Avenue until further notice.’
