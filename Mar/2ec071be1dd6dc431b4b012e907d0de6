Suleiman Ajenifuja also said he works on the side as a street sweeper in Lagos, but the charms he was about to make would boost his sewing business.

The father of two said  a friend connected him to the Islamic cleric.

He explained he cane about the three skulls while working a night shift when he saw a bag containing the skulls.

“I initially wanted to drop the bag, but someone told me that the skulls could be used for some things,” he said,

“I contacted one of the boys that we usually talk together, named Saheed, and he gave me the Alfa’s phone number.”

The alfa invited hin to come along wth the skulls to Ilorin, giving him directions on how to find his way in the city the tailor said he has never been to.

“He had earlier asked me what I wanted to do with the items and I told him that I wanted what would bring more people to my shop.”

Kwara State Commissioner of Police Ado Lawan said the suspect was arrested on March 26 by operatives of the Federal Highway Patrol Team of the command that intercepted an Ilorin-bound passenger vehicle.

According to him, when the passengers were searched, three skulls wrapped in a sack were recovered from a black bag belonging to Ajenifuja.

The CP said the suspect admitted to being the owner of the exhibits and claimed to be taking them to Ilorin from Lagos for ritual purposes.

He said Ajenifuja will be arraigned after investigation.
