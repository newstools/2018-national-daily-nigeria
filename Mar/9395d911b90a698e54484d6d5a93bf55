“You will recall that the ban on the importation of foreign rice through the land was to encourage efficiency in local production.  Therefore, the need to support the Federal Government policy on Rice, encourage local rice farmers, the millers and patronize our own nutritional rice cannot be over emphasized.
Among the detained vehicles include 2 Lexus Jeep (RS350 2016,2017 model), 1 Rolls Royce, 1 Lincoln Limousine (2014), 3 Toyota Camry(2009,2013 and 2017 models), 1 Toyota Rav 4, 1 Toyota Avalon (2016) 1Toyota Tundra, 1 Dodge among others .
