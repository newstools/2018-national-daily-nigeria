Nullifies tenure extension of NWC, others




President Muhammadu Buhari has sacrificed the national chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the search for new formula of rebuilding the ruling party and repositioning it for 2019 general elections.
Accordingly, President Buhari at the National Executive Committee meeting on Tuesday in Abuja nullified the elongation of the tenure of the All Progressives Congress (APC) National Chairman, Chief John Odigie-Oyegun, the National Working Committee (NWC) and other executives endorsed at the February 27, 2018, NEC meeting in Abuja chaired by President Buhari, declaring it illegal.
The President stated that after due consultation, it has become necessary to overturn the NEC resolution of February 27, 2018, which endorsed tenure elongation.
The President remarked that tenure elongation breaches the constitution of the APC and Nigeria’s constitution which prescribes that everyone seeking to occupy public office must present himself for election.
President Buhari also told APC members that they must avoid actions that will lead to litigations in court which could deepen the conflicts in the ruling party.
APC national leader, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, was absent at the meeting. Tinubu had also on Monday cautioned APC that elongation of the tenure of Oyegun, the NWC and other executive breaches the party’s constitution.
President Buhari may have aligned with the Tinubu argument in his decision.
