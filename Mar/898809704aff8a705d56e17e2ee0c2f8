Students of the Moshood Abiola Polytechnic (MAPOLY), Abeokuta protested the non-release of their examination results by locking the school’s main gate.
The protest was instigated by higher national diploma final year students.
The students lamented that results of the exams concluded in January had not yet been released, hindering them from being mobilised for the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) in April.
Both academic and non-academic staff have been denied access to the compound.
In December, twenty students of the institution were arrested by operatives of the special anti-robbery squad (SARS) while protesting the delay of their second semester examination.
The students allegedly destroyed public property, attacked policemen and passersby while protesting.
The delay was as a result of the industrial action embarked upon by the Academic Staff Union Polytechnics (ASUP) of MAPOLY over the relocation of the institution to Ipokia, Ogun state.
The industrial action which crippled academic activities in the institution for three months was suspended in January.
