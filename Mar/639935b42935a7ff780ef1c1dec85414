Chief Operating Officer, Bet9ja Nigeria National League, Mr.Lawrence Katken has listed cogent reasons for again shifting the commencement date of the 2017-2018 season,as follows:
1.The inability of clubs to formally conclude their registration process.
2.None compliance of the forty (40) clubs to forward to the Secretariat requested club/players,club/technical and Management staff contract agreements .
3.The essence of item number two (2) is in keeping with the resolve of NNL to ensure that principal actors are well taken care of.
However ,the NNL has appealed to clubs  that are yet to meet up and or complete their registration formalities to do so within the next seven days,starting from Wednesday 28 March,2018.
The NNL declares that no club will be allowed to feature in the League without fulfiling its financial  obligations to the League and as well complying with given directives.
A new kick off date will in due course be announced by the NNL.
