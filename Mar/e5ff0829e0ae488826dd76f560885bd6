A boy got killed while allegedly scrambling for naira notes thrown by a federal lawmaker near the Bauchi-Maiduguri highway in the weekend.

Bappah Adamu, 13, was reportedly knocked down by a vehicle while Halliru Jika the member representing Ganjuwa/Darazo Federal Constituency in the House of Representatives.

The incident reportedly occurred at Konkiyel village when the lawmaker was leaving the town after inspecting a project he was executing there.

The notes were splashed into the air near the highway and people rushed to pick the notes scattered on the road.

A politician in the area, who spoke to newsmen, however, said he was aware that the lawmaker visited Darazo, Soro and Konkyel on Saturday.

According to him, the money-spraying lawmaker was booed in Soro, but could not confirm the death of the 13-year-old in Konkiyel town.

But in a swift reaction, Jika said the death of the boy had nothing to do with his visit.
He said the boy was knocked down by a car about one hour after he left Konkiyel town.

Jika said no incident happened in Soro where he spent more than one hour.
