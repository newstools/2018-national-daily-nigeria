Manchester United’s Paul Pogba has told TyC Sports he would love to play alongside Neymar one day.

In an interview with La Liga’s website two years ago, Neymar sung Pogba’s praises and stated an ambition to play in the same side as the Frenchman.

“I remember [what he said]. I really like him, too,” Pogba told the Argentine TV channel. “He is truly the definition of joy on the pitch. He also has this.

“I know that in Brazil, football is everything. It’s life. Everyone plays football in Brazil. When I see him play on the pitch and enjoying himself, with his technique, his agility … I love to watch him play.”

Known for his unique fashion sense as well as his distinctive style of play that bears hallmarks of the street football he grew up playing in the Parisian suburbs, Pogba sees in Neymar another man with his own take on the game.

“It’s a different style. He has his own style,” Pogba said. “When you say Neymar anywhere in the world, everyone knows who he is and what he does. For me, it would be a pleasure to play with him one day.”
