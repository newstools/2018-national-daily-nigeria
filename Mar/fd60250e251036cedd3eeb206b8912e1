The House of Reps member who sponsored the controversial Non Governmental Organisation regulatory commission bill, Umar Jubril is dead.
Jubril, 57, a lawmaker representing Lokoja/Kogi federal constituency in the house of representatives, died in Abuja after a brief illness.
According to Amuda Dan Sulaiman, one of his political associates, Jubril, a three time member of the house, died after a brief illness.
Jibril sponsored the controversial non-governmental organisation regulatory commission bill.
When he introduced the bill, he said there was no existing framework “to supervise the mode of operations” of NGOs.
Amid the controversy generated by the bill’s introduction, Jibril had said the legislation was aimed at ensuring transparency and accountability in the way and manner NGOs collect funds.
“The NGO bill, therefore, is primarily to set up a commission to regulate their activities and provide a platform for robust relationships between them and the government for the interests of Nigerians,” he had said.
During a public hearing organised to deliberate on the bill in December 2017, no civil society organisation and non-governmental organisation spoke in support of it.
Jibril was until his death the deputy majority leader of the house. He was also a former speaker of the Kogi state house of assembly.
He was also a former leader of the Kogi state house of assembly.
