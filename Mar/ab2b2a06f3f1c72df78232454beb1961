Boko Haram insurgents have returned the schoolgirls abducted from Government Girls Science Technical College, Dapchi, Yobe state.

Amharic M-grah, a Dapchi resident whose daughters were among the 110 abducted students, told National Daily that his children were brought back on Wednesday morning.

“The report is true. I have seen my two daughters who were kidnapped last month,” he said.

M-grah was among the people who spoke during a trip to Dapchi in February. Back then, his wife said she had not slept for 10 days as a result of the kidnap.

Another resident said there is confusion in the town as many people are running out of fear.

“Boko Haram just returned the kidnapped girls this morning. They brought them back in the same set of vehicles which they used in conveying them last month,” the resident said.

“People are scared because they do not know what the insurgents are up to.”
Meanwhile, it was gathered that five of the girls died in captivity.

Last week, Mansur Dan Ali, minister of defence, said the girls would soon be reunited with their parents.
