Former Nigeria international Emmanuel Amuneke has decided to leave Sudan Premier League side Al Khartoum Watani on a mutual agreement as the club manager, National Daily gathered.
Amuneke, who coached Nigeria Under-17 side between 2014 and 2017 before joining the Sudanese club, confirmed he has left the club and revealed he was owed two months salaries while in charge of the club, even only joined in January.
“I wasn’t  sacked. The director of the club called me to a meeting to explain why we have not been paid and he suggested that we take a pay cut as their major sponsors have not been supportive,” Amuneke told National Daily.
“But they (Al Khartoum Watani) agreed to pay what is being owed and of course what’s binding in the contract which was signed between both parties.
“The director was sincere and plain in his meeting with me on the dire financial conditions of the club. So there was no point staying on. I wasn’t sacked like they’re claiming here in Sudan.”
