The Jama’atu Nasril Islam, under the leadership of the Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji  Sa’ad Abubakar III, has criticised on the federal government  and security agencies for the abduction of 110 Dapchi pupils on February 19 by Boko Haram.
The group said in statement issued in Kaduna on Thursday the abduction of 110  girls is sure  to frustrate the girl-child education.
“No parent now is comfortable, especially in the North-East, to allow his daughter to go to such callously unprotected schools; and the North is the loser.”
The Secretary General of the JNI, Dr Abubakar Khalid-Ailyu, said a serious government would have “by now sanctioned those implicated in the Dapchi girls’ travails.”
The group warned that government must not spare anyone found culpable in the abduction of the Dapchi girls, dismissing the idea a probe that will end up in waste baskets.
The JNI lamented that after four years of the unresolved Chibok girls’ abduction, the country was witnessing “yet another unfortunate and avoidable abduction of Dapchi girls.
 “There is apparent lack of synergy between security operatives in Yobe State, or there is active connivance with the insurgents, especially if reports of media altercations between the army and the police are anything to go by.”
The group wondered why the abduction happened months before the 2019 general elections, just like it did in the Chibok girls’ abduction in 2014.

“Are there orchestrated plans somewhere to make a case for more security votes?”
Yobe Gov. Ibrahim Geidam claimed the state has spent N15.8 billion assisting in the federal government counterinsurgency in the state, and he has been blaming the
Defence Headquarters for withdrawing troops from the area before the terrorists struck.
