The European Union has charged the federal government to first bring to justice perpetrators of the recurrent clashes between herdsmen and farmers in Nigeria.
A statement on Tuesday by its Heads of Mission in Nigeria said this is the necessary first step towards creating peace in the country.
President Muhammadu Buhari has insisted in all its statements on the matter –that herdsmen and farmers must learn to live together. It was not until last week he gave his sternest order ever, directing all security agencies to arrest herders bearing arms.

His critics believe the ethnic connection between him and the Fulani herders had made him somewhat cold to acting decisively against the mostly aggressive herders.
Buhari has simce embarked on tour of the affected states where hundreds of lives have been wasted, especially across the north-central, and some part northwest.
Scores of herders have been arrested on Benue and other places, no one has yet been prosecuted.
“While we welcome the visit of President Buhari to affected states, we encourage the government and all stakeholders to engage decisively in order to promote a constructive dialogue with the aim of finding viable solutions and sustainable economic policies that would permit all to live in peace, whatever their ethnicity or religion.
“As a first step, the perpetrators of violence must be brought to justice,” the statement said.
The body also restated its full support to the Nigerian government and people in their fight against violence in all its forms and expresses its condolences and sympathy to the families of those killed and injured.
