President Muhammadu Buhari has revealed to the people of Benue he never knew IGP Ibrahim Idris did not relocate to the state as he directed the police boss to do in the wake of the January killings in the state.
He said Idris spent a day and took off.
But the president insisted on Monday he did the needful by ordering the IGP to relocate to the state but added.
On the incessant crisis between herders and farmers in the state, the president said the two will always be together.
“The relationship between farmers and herders will continue; it behoves on us to keep encouraging ourselves to continue to live together peacefully,” the President said.
He also refuted the insinuation that he abandoned the people of the state in their trying moments.
“I have friends here in the state. There is no way I can deliberately overlook what is happening here and other parts of the country.”
He reminded those antagonising his government that his campaign promises are largely based corruption, security, and economy.
After listening to the state leaders airing their grievances, Buhari said he would not make any promises until the next time he visits the state.
Benue has been losing lives since January when 73 people were killed.
“Sixty-five more people have been killed after the mass burial of the 73 victims, also 26 more were killed in Okpokwu, with over 5,000 displaced in Mbatoho community,”Gov. Samuel Ortom said.
