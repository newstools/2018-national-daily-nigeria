The Nigerian Senate President, Bukola Saraki has instructed the media and followers to not link him with his former aide on youth affairs who resigned because of am appointment in a new political party.

Ikenga Ugochinyere, who is now the chairman of a newly registered political party, Action Peoples Party (APP), resigned from Saraki’s office last October to chair the party.

According to his special adviser on media, the senate president also denied any link with the APP, and he asked all platforms to refrain from including his name in stories relating to Ugochinyere.

Yusuph Olaniyonu explained that Ugochinyere was president of the National Youth Council of Nigeria before he formed the political party.

“In this regard, we ask that all platforms be guided in their reporting of the activities of Ugochinyere and his party, and refrain from including ‘Saraki’s’ name in any of such related stories.”

The Senate president has been in the rumour of party hopping since last year, and many still believe he is biding his time—at the appropriate time, he will shop out.



 
His critics believe the APC stalwart has been scheming all along for the 2019 presidency in his former party PDP.
