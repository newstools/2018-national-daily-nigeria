Barcelona have began plans for life without Andres Iniesta after accepting he is more likely to swap life at the Nou Camp for a lucrative final pay day in the Chinese Super League.

The 33-year-old remains a key player under Ernesto Valverde and will continue do be so if he chooses to stay beyond this summer. But, according to Sport, the club believe huge offers from the Far East are starting to sway him.

Iniesta only signed a so-called ‘contract for life’ in October, but the club are ready to let him dictate his own future this summer and allow him to leave unobstructed should he choose to do so.

Although no team within the CSL has been attributed with a concrete interest, it has been claimed that Iniesta could earn as much as £600,000 per week if he makes the controversial move.

That would put him on par with the highest earners in world football with his current team-mate Lionel Messi believed to be the leader on £500,000 per week. The Argentine’s latest Barcelona deal also included a staggering £80million signing fee.

Iniesta has been told that he will continue to be an important first-team player if he stays for another season, but the arrival of Philippe Coutinho in January suggests a succession plan is already in place.
