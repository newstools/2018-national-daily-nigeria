Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC) has expressed sympathies for Leah, the only Christian girl Boko Haram holds back among the 1O6 Dapchi schoolgirls the terrorists abducted February 19.

No fewer than 105 of them were released Wednesday, while five of them, according to a victim’s account, died in the hold of Boko Haram.

MURIC condemns the terrorists’ attempt to compel Leah to use hijab, saying it’s un-Islamic to force somebody to become a Muslim.

“We salute her courage,’ the group said in a press release Wednesday by its leader Prof Ishaq Akintola.

“Shame on Boko Haram for  oppressing a lone, vulnerable, and helpless girl. Shame on all those who surpress  freedom of worship.”

MURIC has been an outspoken advocate of Muslim rights in Nigeria, taking very controversial positions against many secular policies it feels impinge on Muslims’ freedom in Nigeria.

The group has however charged President Muhammadu Buhari not to kick back yet until young Leah gets safely out of captivity.

“Nigerians have been united in their prayers for the release of the Dapchi girls,” the group added.

It warned the federalgovernment  to note that Boko Haram is not as daft as many people think.

“By withholding  the Christian girl, they seek to divide Nigerians once again along religious lines.”

It also advised the government to not rely on miltary victory alone (which it described as pyrrhic victory if the conquest lacks ideological re-engineering) to end the Boko Haram crisis.

The 105 girls released yesterday are now in Abuja to meet with the federal government officials.
