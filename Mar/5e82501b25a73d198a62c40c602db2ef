The House of Representatives has recalled its former Chairman, Committee on Appropriation, Mr. Abdulmumini Jibrin, from suspension.
Jibrin’s journey out of the House began two years ago when he accused the leadership of the House of Reps of padding the 2016 budget with N40 billion.
The House resolved to suspend him after he failed to respond to a panel set up to probe the matter.
His 180 legislative days’ suspension expired last June, but the lower chamber never lifted the suspension.
At some point, the Kano chapter of the APC also expelled him for his anti-party activities, especially for opposing Gov. Abdullahi Ganduje.
Since 2016 he was expelled, Jibrin was able to meet President Muhammadu Buhari early in the year.
All his attempt to explain his side of the story to Buhari was frustrated, whereas, Speaker Yakubu Dogara whom Jibrin largely indicted was a fixture at Aso Rock then.
