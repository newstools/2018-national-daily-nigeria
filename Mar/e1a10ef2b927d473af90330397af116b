The former Atletico Beleares midfielder, Raheem Lawal told National Daily Esther Egbe recently in a chat that he is disappointed he has long been overlooked by the Eagles despite his sparkling showings and consistency in Turkey.
You have been consistent for your club Osmanlispor in Turkey, what is behind this?
It’s just Allah’s favour, he gave me the talent and the strength to show the world. The hard work I put into training also complements my talent.
But despite these displays, you have been overlooked by the national team selectors, are you unhappy with this?
Not really because Nigeria is blessed with abundant talents and all I know all of us cannot be in the team at once.
Do you crave a chance to play for the Eagles again?
Yes of course, playing for the Eagles is serving my fatherland and contributing my quota. I am always interested in representing my country.
If you were given a second chance in Eagles, what do you think you can bring to the team?
I will work with the team, I will give my best and I believe I have all it takes to make it good. I will give my best towards our common goal of winning and making Nigeria proud.
How was it playing for the Eagles?
It is usually a great experience, always awesome to play for Nigeria.
Do you still talk with your Eagles mates?
Yes of course. We are all family, friends and colleagues. We always communicate.
How would you rate the leagues in Turkey and Spain, where you started outside Nigeria?
La Liga is La Liga, but trust me the Turkish league is tough and one of the best 10 leagues around the world.
What are the chances of the Super Eagles at Russia 2018? 
With the kind of coach we have now, the quality and youthfulness of the players coupled with our new vibrant NFF leadership on the management side, we stand a good chance of springing surprises in Russia.
