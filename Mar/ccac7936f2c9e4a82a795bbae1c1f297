Toni Iwobi, a Nigerian IT entrepreneur who has spent 38 years in Italy, has become the first black senator in the European country.

He was elected in the industrial city of Brescia in northern Italy. “Friends, it is with great emotion that I inform you that I was elected senator of the Republic!” he said in a statement.

“After over 25 years of battles in the great family of the league, it is about to start another great adventure! My thanks go to Matteo Salvini, a great leader who led the league to become the first centre-Centre force of the country!

“I have to thank then my National Secretary Paolo Grimoldi, my now former provincial secretary and new Congressman Daniele Belotti, the whole team of the department for work done over these years, the great league militants and all Facebook friends for their support.

“I can’t forget my family, without them I wouldn’t have come here today because they never stopped supporting me and being close to me! Thank you, thank you, and thank you! I’m ready, friends!”

A member of the anti-migrant League, Iwobi emerged a town councilor in 1995. Iwobi is said to be the party’s immigration and security chief, speaking regularly on Italian TV.

Ansa en Politics, an Italian website, described him as a committed activist.
