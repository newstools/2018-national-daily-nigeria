The Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) in Rivers State, has arrested 12 suspected pipeline vandals and oil thieves in different parts of the state.

NSCDC also disclosed that it impounded seven trucks, two cars and two boats loaded with thousands of litres of stolen crude oil and adulterated petroleum products.

The Rivers State command of the NSCDC made this known in Port Harcourt while marking its 2018 Civil Defence Day tagged: ‘Civil Defence and the National Institutions for more efficient Disaster Management.’

Speaking, the State Commandant of NSCDC, Mohammed Haruna, noted that the suspects and the products were arrested in different parts of the state through its intelligence network and useful information from the public and other sister security agencies.

He said: “It is our duty to go after oil thieves, vandals and those who deal in stolen products. We discovered these products and suspects through intelligence network. Some members of the public are cooperating with us and they are helping us with useful information.

“We have arrested 12 suspects and they have been arraigned in court. We arrested one of the suspects at Ogbakiri with suspected adulterated AGO in 40,000 litres truck. Two suspects arrest in Bori with two trucks, loaded with 40,000 litres of product.”

Haruna, however, noted that the command has put measures in place to forestall acts capable of causing disaster in the state, adding that it has embarked on a campaign to tackle issues of outbreak of fire as a result of use of adulterated petroleum products.

He stated that the command has consistently combed creeks in the area, resulting in the arrest of many oil thieves.

According to him, the offence contravened sections 312 and 285 of the Criminal Laws of Lagos State 2011.

The Magistrate, Mukaila Fadeyi adjourned the case till May 2, 2018 for continuation of trial.
