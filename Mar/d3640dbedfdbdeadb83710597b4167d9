Several youths trooped out in their hundreds under the banner #NotTooYoungToRungroup to protest the decline of President Muhammadu Buhari’s to assent to the Electoral Act Amendment by the two Chambers of the National Assembly.
The youths were gathered to have besieged the entrance to the Presidential Villa displaying placards of different inscriptions to communicate their message to President Buhari.
The protesting youths converged at the Unity Fountain in Abuja on Wednesday morning and thereafter marched to the entrance of the Presidential Villa bearing placards with various inscriptions.
The members of #NotTooYoungToRungroup condemned the refusal of the President to assent to the Electoral Act that Amendment which seeks to re-order the sequence of 2019 elections.
The protesters who barricaded the entrance to the Presidential Villa turned down entreaties by the Senior Special Assistant to the President on New Media who was sent to address them; they insisted that a higher government official in the caliber of a Minister or the Secretary to the Government of the Federation be sent to address them.
President Muhammadu Buhari had on Tuesday written to the National Assembly withholding his assent to the amendment of the 2010 Electoral Act.
In the letter, which was read on the floor during plenary by the Senate President Bukola Saraki, Buhari said the amendments by the lawmakers were in conflict with existing laws.
