The APC has set up a committee to advise it on President Muhammadu Buhari’s objection to the extension of the tenure of the national working committee (NWC).
But, in the meantime, the committee stands is that the tenure extension decision remains–no natter what party leader Buhari has said.
The extension of Oyegun and other executives across the 36 states was decided at the national executive council (NEC) meeting in February, with effect from June.
Buhari at the party’s NEC meeting on Tuesday said the tenure extension is  unconstitutional.
“I have taken some time to review and seek advice on the resolution and what I have found is that it contravenes our party constitution and the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria,” he said.
He also pointed out how such decision can result in huge litigation.
Bolaji Abdullahi, the spokesman of the party, who informed journalists of the stting up of technical committtee, pointed out that issues that goes to court is sub-judicial.
“At the moment, there is no decision taken. So, the position of NEC still stands from the last meeting,’ he said.
“That position may change tomorrow but as it is today, that is the position of NEC.”
Apart from Buhari, mational leader Bola Tinubu also objects to the NWC decision.
The former governor’s position was about firing off another round on internal party crisis as sides loyal to to both were already spitting fire.
