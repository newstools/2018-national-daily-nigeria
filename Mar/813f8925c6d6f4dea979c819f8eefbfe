Three suspects have been arrested by the Nigerian Navy over illegal bunkering in Ibaka, Mbo Local Government Area of Akwa Ibom State.

The Navy also seized the boat used by the suspects in the business which the Navy said was Automotive Gas Oil bunkering worth N23m.

The suspects and the seized boat were handed over to the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps by the Commanding Officer, FOB, Captain Yusuf Idris at Ibaka for further action.

Idris said the Navy seized 406 drums of illegally-refined AGO, five outboard engines, four pumping machines.

He said, “I will like to hand over three suspects arrested by our men and patrol team recently. They were caught in a boat with products suspected to be illegally-refined AGO with about 406 drums in it.

“Other items in the boat, including five outboard engines and four pumping machines, were also recovered from the suspects. The Nigerian Navy is all out to wage a war against illegalities wherever they are and arrest the perpetrators of those crimes in our maritime domain.

“We have made several arrests and we keep making, hoping that one day, perhaps, they will yield to the advice that we always give, that they embrace a reliable and genuine way of livelihood”

The Commandant of the NSCDC, Mrs. Obiangeli Obiajulo, commended the Navy for their exploits.

She was represented by the Divisional Officer of Mbo Local Lovernment Area, Mr. James Udeme, CIC 2.
