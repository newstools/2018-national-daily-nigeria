Data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) petrol price watch for the month of February released this week shows the average petrol price paid in Nigeria fell by 9.6% from N190.9 paid in January to N172.5 in February. Year on year, the price is a 15% increase compared to the N149.8 paid in February 2017.

Plateau state had the highest average petrol price in February at N208.8 per litre. Osun state had the second highest average price at N201.29per litre. Next to this is Edo state, with an average price of N200.83 per litre.

Abuja and Katsina both had the lowest price on average at N145. Kogi State had the second lowest average petrol price at N147.06 per litre.
The fall in average petrol price could be an indication that the crippling fuel scarcity which began in December last year seems to have eased out.
