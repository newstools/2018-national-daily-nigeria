Otunba Sunday Dele-Ajayi, the chairman of the newly inaugurated audit committee of Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) says his committee is not set up to probe or witch hunt anyone but to ensure the federation’s books are in order,National Daily gathered.

Dele-Ajayi made this known to National Daily after inauguration of  the committee in Abuja.

“We are not probing anybody, we are to work with the administrative department of the Nigeria Football Federation. When we do things right and properly, it will underline the transparency, accountability and openness of the NFF and thereby make us more attractive to corporate organisations.”

National Daily gathered that “We have reached an age where football is the brand to be sold. Every structure in the federation must push that agenda. Every conduct, action and inaction must add value to the brand. This is why the Audit Committee becomes as important as the face of the NFF.”

“For instance, our external auditors is a global brand, if we have a query from the external auditors, we are to provide answers to satisfy them in preparing our final book of accounts and that also presents us as veritable to do big football business,” he said.
