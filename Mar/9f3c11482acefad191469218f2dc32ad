The People’s Democratic Party (PDP) has commended ex-President Olusegun Obasanjo; Ibrahim Babangida, a former military ruler; and Theophilus Danjuma, a former minister of defence; for “saying the truth” about the state of the country.
National Chairman of the party, Uche Secondus gave the commendation in his Easter message to Nigerians.
He said the leaders have spoken the minds of all Nigerians as the ruling All Progressive Party (APC) has failed to meet the yearnings of the people.
The PDP boss who said the country is under siege, urged Nigerians to use the Easter period to pray for the survival of democracy in the country.
“The nation’s democracy more than ever before since 1999 is under heavy stress that need all hands to be on deck for its survival,” the statement by Abonyi read.
“Indicators are apparent that the country is under siege and Nigerians should use this solemn period of Easter to pray for God to intervene and raise good leaders for the country.”
Secondus advised the All Progressives Congress (APC) administration to shun all undemocratic tendencies that could heighten tension in the land.
“Christians [should] see the Easter festivity which also marks the end of the 40 days special fasting and prayers as an ample period for positive attitude to one another,” he said.
“The new PDP that would emerge after reformation is going to take the country to the next level having been equipped with the requisite experience.”
