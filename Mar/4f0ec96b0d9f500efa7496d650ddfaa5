President Muhammadu Buhari on Wednesday said has score his administration higher compared to his predecessor’s which he claimed was apathetic to the plight of the Chibok schoolgirls Boko Haran kidnapped in 2014.
Buhari said this at a town hall meeting Wednesday while addressing families affected by the February 20 kidnap of 110 schoolgirls by the terrorists at Dapchi, Yobe.
According to him, while the Federal Government under his watch swung into action immediately after the abduction, the last administration did nothing when a similar incident happened in 2014.
 “The federal government’s response to the unfortunate abduction of the school girls is a clear departure from the insensitivity of the past administration which looked the other way while the Chibok girls were taken away in 2014 and held in captivity for over three years.
He said the commitment of his administration had led to the rescue of more than 100 of the Chibok girls abducted when former President Goodluck Jonathan was in office.
Buhari also recalled his government’s negotiation efforts that led to the release of abducted University of Maiduguri lecturers, some women police personnel, students and even an NYSC member.
“We, therefore, have no doubt that the Dapchi girls will be rescued or released,” he said.
“ I can reassure parents, Nigerians and the International Community that we will do all that is within our power to make sure that the girls are brought back safely to their families.”
It took Buhari three weeks to pay an official visit to Dapchi after incident, though his ministers and security chiefs were deployed there immediately the girls were abducted.
