The Federal Government has directed shipping companies to give their cargo manifest to the Nigerian Customs Service (NCS) and the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) seven days before their ships arrive at the ports.
The advance manifest, it was gathered, will enable the government to know the cargoes’ details and the risks before the vessels’ arrival.
The Presidential Enabling Business Environment Council (PEBEC) issued the directive during its meeting at the Nigerian Shippers Council (NSC) office in Lagos recently.
According to the Senior Special Assistant (SSA) to the President on Industry, Trade and Investment, Dr. Jumoke Oduwole, she said the directive became imperative because of the government’s determination to enthrone global best practices and facilitate trade.
To ensure compliance with the Executive Order on 24-hour ports operations, Oduwole said the government had instructed that shipping agencies must submit their manifest electronically to the Customs and NPA seven days before the arrival of any vessel.
She added that President Muhmmadu Buhari administration is currently focusing on issues causing insecurity, inefficiency and delay at the ports.
