A 32-year-old woman and mother of two at Ughelli, Delta, took her own life in protest against her husband’s infidelity during the week.
Peace Uzezi Akpobaro, bank worker, was found dead with bottles of Sniper and Fanta lying beside her, which made police authorities believe she took the lethal cocktail.
Akpobaro’s husband was said to have brought home his mistress, thereby provoking his wife to that fatal jealousy.
The Ughelli ‘B’ Division police station, Agbarha-Otor, said that her corpse has since been deposited at the morgue of a private mortuary.
“Investigation into the matter is still ongoing.”
