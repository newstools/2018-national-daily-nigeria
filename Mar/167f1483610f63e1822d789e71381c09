Norwich have put a staggering Â£25m price on hot midfield property James Maddison.

Tottenham and Chelsea are leading the chase for the England under-21 starlet and Norwich are expecting a summer auction at the end of the season.

Everton and Manchester City are two other clubs who have watched him extensively this season and Maddison is ready to make the jump to the top flight.

Maddison has been marked down as one of the best prospects outside of the Premier League and virtually every top club has been scouring him.

Norwich are determined to get a big price for the goalscoring midfielder who has been the star of their season in the Championship.
