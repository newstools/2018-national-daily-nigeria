Embattled Senator representing Kogi West, Dino Melaye has urged his supporters to be calm, saying he’s proceeding to the Supreme Court to challenge the judgement of the appeal court over the bid to recall him from the upper legislative chamber.

On Friday, the court of appeal, Abuja, dismissed all the grounds of appeal which Melaye filed against the judgement of the federal high court in Abuja.

The lower court had asked the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to proceed with the senator’s recall.
Melaye, through Mike Ozekhome, his lawyer, had requested a federal high court in Abuja to declare the petition submitted to INEC on his recall as illegal and unconstitutional.

He also asked the court to nullify the recall, saying it breached his rights but Nnamdi Dimgba, the presiding judge, did not grant Melaye’s prayers.

Few hours after losing out the appellate court, Melaye assured his supporters not to be bothered as he “is appealing the judgement of the appeal court immediately”.

 “The judgement by the appeal court today is nothing to be bothered about. I urge my supporters to be relaxed as though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death yet I fear no evil. Every lie has an expiry date. We are appealing the judgement immediately,” Melaye tweeted.
