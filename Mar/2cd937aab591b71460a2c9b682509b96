Chelsea manager, Antonio Conte has revealed what he told Barcelona Superstar immediately after the Champions League round of 16 second leg at Camp Nou on Wednesday.

Conte said he personally praised Messi for his performance after Barcelona dumped Chelsea out of the competition.

The Argentine struck twice at Camp Nou and assisted Ousmane Dembele for his first-half goal as Barcelona ended up comfortably securing a place in the quarter-final draw.

At the sound of the final whistle, the Italian approached Messi on two separate occasions and exchanged words with him.

Conte also hugged the 30-year-old as they made their way off the pitch

Asked what he told Messi, the former Juventus boss said in his post-match press conference, “When you have the opportunity to make a great complement to Messi, it is right to recognise a super, super, super top player.

“You are talking about a player who every season can score 60 goals, not just in one season

“I am very pleased to have the opportunity at the end of the game to give him my complement.

“We are talking about an extraordinary player, the best in the world.”
