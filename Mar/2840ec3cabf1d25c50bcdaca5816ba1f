Super Eagles midfielder, Mikel Agu who got a late callup to replace the unavailable Mikel Obi is set to touch down in London today ahead of the second Super Eagles International friendly against Serbia.
The Bursaspor Defensive Midfielder told National Daily “I will be in  London today to join up with the rest of the squad.”
He also gave his insight about the Super Eagles victory over Poland at Wrocław saying, “Yea, it was a great game yesterday for the entire team as they did well collectively as a team.”
Filling in for the “Odogwu” always comes with a burden of expectation but the former Porto FC Player has to such pressure would not get to him, rather he’d go out and enjoy what he love best while giving his best as well if called upon.
The Benin-born Nigeria International concluded by stating he had a long way to go in order to reach his full potential and also hopes that the benefits of having three Super Eagles Players in the same club would rub off on the National Team.
