By Boluwatife Ezekiel Olaleye

Former Minister of Education, Oby Ezekwesili, has described President Muhammadu Buhari as ‘a leading contestant in the competition of the incompetents.’

She accused President Buhari of unduly comparing his incompetence in office with that of his predecessor.

The ex-Minister wrote on her Twitter handle: “Is this not a BIG SHAME? Our President Buhari is a leading contestant in the “Competition of the Incompetents”.

“We the citizens are not interested in this game of comparing one level of failure with another level of failure so please collect your #RedCardToAPCAndPDP.”
