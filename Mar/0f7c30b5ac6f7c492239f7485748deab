Barcelona star, Lionel Messi has explained his new role at the club.

Messi revealed that he has become less selfish and has evolved into more of a team player.

The 30-year-old disclosed that he does not play individual football like before.

According to Messi, he tries to move the team from one position to another on the pitch.

“Before, I used to try to steal the ball and make something happen on my own — or at least try to do something on my own,” Messi told America TV.

“Now, I try to make the team play more. I pass the ball more and I try not to be so selfish, if you will. I try to move the team from one position to another. I still run as much as ever, just in a different way.”

Meanwhile, Messi is effectively the second forward in a 4-4-2 formation under manager, Ernesto Valverde.

The forward increasingly finds himself in a deeper position, often dropping into his own half to get on the ball in central positions and dictate play.
