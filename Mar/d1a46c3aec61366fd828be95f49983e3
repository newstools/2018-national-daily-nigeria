Liverpool have been dealt a huge injury blow as one of their key defenders will miss both Champions League games against Manchester City.

Joe Gomez has reportedly been ruled out for a month with an ankle injury sustained during England’s 1-0 win over the Netherlands on Friday.

The Sun claims that an early diagnosis has ruled him out for four weeks, meaning he would miss both legs of the Champions League quarter-final against City.

Gomez has made 29 appearances for Jurgen Klopp’s side so far this season, establishing himself as in important player in the Reds’ rearguard.

The versatile 20-year-old was given his opportunity at right-back in the Liverpool team due to the long-term injury sustained by Nathaniel Clyne.

In other injury news, Klopp are confident that Emre Can will be back in time for the trip to Crystal Palace this weekend.
