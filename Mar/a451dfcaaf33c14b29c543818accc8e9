Okpoma, a town in Yala Local Government Area of Cross River State, had a deathly drama during the week when a housewife identified as Alice allegedly pounded the head of a man in a free-for-all with her husband.

The man known as Ogar Olaje slumped and died later.

Alice’s husband and Olaje were both friends and commercial motorcyclists. They had  a dispute on who was next in turn at the Olokpoma park.
 
The ensuing argument spiralled into a hand-to-hand, and Olaje appeared to be pasting Alice’s husband, according eyewitness account.
Alice grabbed a stick, and hammered Olaje’s head slap-bang.
“When the woman realised what she had done, she ran away and nobody has seen her since Tuesday, but the husband has been arrested by the police from OKopma Police Station,” the witness said.
Olaje was rushed to the hospital but died shortly on arrival.
Police are on Alice’s trail now.
