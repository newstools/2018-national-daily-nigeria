Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has said that telecom service providers who fail to offer quality service to consumers, may face sanctions.
Umaru Danbatta, executive vice chairman and CEO, who made this known at 29th Enugu International Trade Fair, said that the commission has embarked on monitoring of user experiences.
Danbatta, said that failure to improve after warning, would come with sanctions on the defaulting service provider.
Represented at the occasion by Tony Ojobo, director, public affairs, NCC; he said “On the quantity service issue, including poor reception, wrong billings and deductions, automatic data roll over among other issues, we have put the service providers on special notice about our current monitoring of user experience and will call them to account in due course.
“Where the provider continues to fail to improve services to the detriment of the consumers, the Commission will apply appropriate regulatory actions and sanctions against such service provider.”
 “On the issue of data roll over, the commission will soon issue a directive to the service providers to give 14 days window to the subscribers to enable them roll over unused data, even if they do not renew on the expiration date. In other words, this will stop the current practice where subscriber lose their entire unused data if they fail to renew on the date of the expiration of the current subscription,” Danbatta declares.
 He pointed out that since 2017, NCC has  been serious about protecting the consumers from unwholesome ill-treatment by the service providers.
