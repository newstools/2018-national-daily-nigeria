Suspected herdsmen have killed at least 25 people in Dundu Village of Kwall district in Bassa local government area of Plateau state.

Many houses were reportedly set ablaze in the latest round of attacks in the state which President Muhammadu Buhari visited last week.

Daniel Kadzia, the village head, said the attackers invaded the village after noticing that the youth and men had gone for mining.

Although Buhari had appealed to stakeholders to resolve their differences, some people were killed during the president’s visit.
A mass burial had been fixed for the victims of last week’s attack but the fresh killings disrupted it.

Matthias Tyopev, spokesman of Plateau police command, confirmed the attack but could not give details.

He said Adie Undie, Plateau commissioner of police, had ordered Taiwo Jebiyisu, deputy commissioner of police (operations), to visit the scene for an on-the-spot assessment.

“There was an attack yesterday (Monday) in Bassa; as such, the commissioner of police, Plateau state command, has directed the DCP Taiwo Jebiyisu, a deputy commissioner of police in charge of the department of operations, to go to the scene of crime for an on-the-spot assessment,” he said.

“As such, he is there now. The information is sketchy. I shall inform you when the details of the attack are made available.”
 
Efforts of the government to check the high rate of insecurity in the state have not yielded the desired result.
