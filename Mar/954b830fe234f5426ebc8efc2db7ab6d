Elder Godsday Peter Orubebe, has declared that he is still a member of the opposition party PDP, debunking the rumour that he has defected.

According to a statement by his spokesman, Gbenga Giwa, he said: “It has come to the knowledge of Elder Godsday Peter Orubebe, through online media that he, among other PDP stalwarts, has decamped to SDP.

Orubebe in the statement said while he cannot begrudge people for decamping to whatever party for whatever reasons, let it be known that, he, Elder Godsday Peter Orubebe, is still a member of PDP.

He said decamping is a very serious issue, and as someone who is very blunt and direct, he will not shy away from telling the public himself, if or when he decides to leave PDP.

“It is no secret that PDP faces a lot of challenges, particularly arising from its last National Convention of 9 December 2017, but decamping is not the solution. We will stay together and resolve the issues together.”

Elder Orubebe assures his teeming supporters, followers, leaders and all stakeholders in PDP that he is fully committed to the party and it is his desire that all hands must be on deck for PDP to take power back from APC in 2019.
