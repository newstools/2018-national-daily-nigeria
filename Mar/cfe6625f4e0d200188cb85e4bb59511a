Lionel Messi has revealed that a change in his diet is the reason he no longer gets sick and vomits on the pitch during games.

The Barcelona forward admitted in 2014 that it happened to him “all the time”, after vomiting while playing an international friendly with Argentina.

“I ate badly for many years: chocolates, fizzy drinks, and everything.

“That is what made me throw up during games. Now I look after myself better. I eat fish, meat, salads. Everything is organised and taken care of,” Messi told La Cornisa TV.

There had been concerns that Messi might have an illness, or was suffering from stress.

“I’ve learnt to live the way I do, to be myself because at the end of the day it’s easier to do it that way,” the 30-year-old added. “I don’t think too much about how I have to act because of constantly being watched. I’m aware that whenever I speak there are many people that listen, that there are repercussions. I always try to think about what I say in order not to generate controversies,” he added.
