Paul Ince believes Alexis Sanchez is at the heart of Manchester United’s recent struggles and insists that the more the former Arsenal attacker tries, the worse Jose Mourinho’s side get.

The Chile international has scored just one goal since his arrival at Old Trafford and he failed to make an impact as the Red Devils crashed out of the Champions League at the hands of Sevilla on Tuesday night.

After impressing at Arsenal during a four-year stint, it was hoped that Sanchez would provide the answer to United’s attacking problems but the solution has yet to materialise.

Ince is convinced that Sanchez, who was believed to be close to joining Premier League table toppers Manchester City, must be seriously regretting completing a switch to United.

And he thinks that the Barcelona man simply doesn’t suit Mourinho’s style of football.

‘Sanchez keeps trying to do things and make things happen, but the more he does the worse the team gets,’ Ince told Paddy Power.

‘I’d bet that he probably wished he’d waited until the end of the season and gone to another team.

‘It’s evident, from watching United since he joined, that he doesn’t suit how Jose Mourinho plays football. You could see him fitting in at Manchester City better.

”Maybe Jose’s plan is to bring in players that do suit the way [Romelu] Lukaku, Sanchez and Pogba play, but how much more can you spend to satisfy other players?

‘They need to look at themselves and how they’re playing, rather than relying on others to help them out.’
