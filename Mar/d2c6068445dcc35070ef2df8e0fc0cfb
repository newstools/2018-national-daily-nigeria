There is palpable tension in Akure, the Ondo state capital as the Supreme Court, this Friday 23, dismissed an appeal filed by Rotimi Akeredolu, governor of Ondo state, on the primary of the All Progressives Congress (APC) primary election in the state.

Akeredolu had challenged a July 2017 judgment of the Court of Appeal, Abuja, which upheld an order by a Federal High Court, granting permission to Olusegun Abraham, an aspirant of the APC in the primary election.

Abraham had sought to serve Akeredolu court documents in relation to a suit he filed, through substituted means.
But the apex court affirmed the decision of an Appeal Court which upheld a ruling of the trial court.

The trial court had granted leave to Abraham to serve the documents through substituted means.

Abraham, thought to be the preferred candidate of Bola Tinubu, national leader of the APC, is challenging the primary election that produced Akeredolu as the party’s candidate.

At the apex court on Friday, a five-man panel of justices led by John Okoro held that the governor’s appeal lacked merit.
 
The court also awarded N500, 000 in the favour of Abraham.
 
Abraham is asking the court that he be declared governor on the basis that he is the actual winner of the primary election.

The substantive matter is before Nnamdi Dimgba, a judge of the Federal High Court, Abuja.
