Information Minister Lai Mohammed has asked the PDP to prove it’s really sorry for blundering for the 16 years it was in power by doing something drastic in addition to the apology.

PDP Chairman Uche Secondus on Monday publicly declared his party made several mistakes that eventually cost them the 2015 general elections.
Secondus said his party has realised its mistakes, and the noblest thing to do was apologise.

But in a statement issued in Abuja on Tuesday, Mohammed said such apology was not enough after presiding over an unprecedented looting of the public treasury, perhaps the worst of its kind in Nigeria or anywhere else in the world.

“Therefore, the best evidence of penitence for such a party is not just to own up and apologise, but to also return the looted funds,” the minister said.
“Anything short of that is mere deceit.”


The PDP is also accused of diverting $2.1 billion arms fund to bankroll former President Goodluck Jonathan’s re-election in the lead-up to the 2015 presidential election which the PDP lost, as Secondus admitted in his Monday confession..


According to him,  with the paucity of funds that characterises President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration, the APC government has spent an unprecedented amount of money on infrastructural development and Social Investment Programme, among others.

“Returning looted funds will provide more money for these programmes and make life more meaningful for Nigerians,” he said.
“There is no better apology than that.”

Buhari, who promised Nigerians change in 2015 when he was campaigning, has been insisting the last PDP administration mismanaged N30 trillion.

The opposition has denied this though, asking him to stop whining over the past, and buckle down to deliver the change he promised.
