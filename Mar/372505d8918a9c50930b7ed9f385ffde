President Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday had a private confrontation with his IGP Ibrahim Idris who the president said flouted his order to relocate to Benue during the Fulani herder-farmer mayhem in the state.
The meeting held at Aso Rock, and lasted for 30 minutes.
 “It is believed the President demanded for a full report on police operations till date after which he will make further decisions,” a villa source told newsmen Tuesday
Idris was said to have left the presidency without grabbing a photo op or telling the press what his oral or partial report was when Buhari confronted him.
Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity Garba Shehu who confirmed the meeting wouldn’t make any comment on how the meeting went.
But Aso Rock had earlier stated Buhari would not just club down the IGP for vanishing from his duty post or disobeying the president.
Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Mr. Femi Adesina said it would not have been proper for Buhari to act on the matter immediately the allegation was made.
“Even in the home, if there is an allegation from somebody, you listen to the other side before you will do whatever you will do,’ he said on Raypower during a political programme Tuesdaymorning.
“Knowing the President as a fair-minded man, he is going to ask him to defend himself and then the next step.”
President Buhari was in Benue on Monday when he learnt the IGP he ordered to relocate to the troubled state spent only a day before bailing out of the state.
Benue has been witnessing series of attacks since the January incident when 73 people were killed by the attackers believed to be Fulani herdsmen.
