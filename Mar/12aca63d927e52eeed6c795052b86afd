The Federal High Court in Abuja has sentenced Charles Okah and Obi Nwabueze to life imprisonment for masterminding the Oct 1 bomb blasts which occurred in Abuja in 2010.
The sentence also covered an earlier blast in March the same year in Warri, Delta.
The two planned the attacks with Charles’ elder brother and leader of the defunct Movement for the Emancipation of Niger Delta.
Henry was convicted of the same offences and sentenced to 24 years’ imprisonment by a South African court in 2013.
Justice Gabriel Kolawole ruled that the prosecution proved the charges preferred against Charles and Nwabueze beyond reasonable doubt.
The two men were convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment as prescribed Sections 15(1) and (2) of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (Establishment) Act, 2004, under which they were charged.
Okah and Nwabueze, Edmund Ebiware and Tiemkemfa Francis-Osvwo (aka General Gbokos) were first arraigned before the court on December 7, 2010.
Francis-Osvwo died later in detention, while Ebiware, who had his trial conducted separately, was convicted on January 25, 2013 and sentenced for life.
No fewer than 12 people died, with many others injured and property, including cars burnt in the blast that went off near the Eagles Square in Abuja during the Independence Day celebration.
The case commenced on December 7, 2010, when the convicts took their pleas.
The attack took place during the PDP government under presided over by Goodluck Jonathan.
