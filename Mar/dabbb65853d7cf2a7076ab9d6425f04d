President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday in Kano attended another wedding Fatiha of Aliko Dangote’s daughter, Fatima, and her groom, Jamilu Abubakar.
The wedding Fatiha between Fatima and Jamilu, son of a former Inspector-General of police, Muhammad Abubakar, took place at 12 noon at the Kano Emir’s palace.
The wedding was conducted by the Emir of Kano, Muhammadu Sanusi II, and supported by the Chief Imam of Kano, Sani Zaharaddeen.
Mr. Buhari, in his capacity as the bride’s father, received N500,000 dowry from the representative of the groom at the occasion.
He paid the bride price when he attended Kano’s Gov. Abdullahi Ganduje’s daughter wedding last month.
Other important personalities that graced the Friday occasion include former Head of State, Abdulsalam Abubakar, Speaker, the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara and some serving senators.
Some governors and ministers as well as traditional rulers from across the country also attended the occasion.
Security at the occasion was tight as all the entrances leading to the palace were cordoned-off by armed security operatives.
Buhari’s attendance at wedding parties has been a subject of discussion by many critics who believe that a sensitive president should not be junketing around at society wedding when the nation is in turmoil.
