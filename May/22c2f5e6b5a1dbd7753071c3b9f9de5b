A 65-year-old man and his 19-year-old son have been remanded in prison custody for allegedly raping their neighbour’s nine-year-old daughter.
Magistrate Hajiya Fadile Dikko of a Katsina senior magistrates’ court directed on Monday that the duo remanded till June 14 when their case will come up for mention.
The police told the court that the accused persons,Lawal Angala and Isa, who resided at Safana town in Kastina State, committed the offence on May 2.
The victim’s mother, Shamsiya Abdullahi, reported the incident at the Safana police division shortly after.
The court heard that the accused persons lured the victim into Angala’s room, and then took turns in having carnal knowledge of her.
The accused persons are now facing rape charge, an offence which the police say, is contrary to Section 283 of the Penal Code.
Hajiya Dikko refused to take the pleas of the accused persons as she reminded them that their offence can only be tried by the high court.
Police prosecutor, Inspector Sani Ado, told the court that investigation into the case was in progress and requested for a new date.
