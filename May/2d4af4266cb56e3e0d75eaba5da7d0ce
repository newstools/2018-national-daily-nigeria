A police officer serving in Benin, Edo state, Michael Eriarebhe has been remanded in prison for allegedly impregnating a minor while in police custody.

Eriarebhe, 33, is facing one-count charge of having forceful carnal knowledge of a minor before Magistrate I.U Iyioha, to which he pleaded not guilty.

The prosecutor, ASP Johnbull Adah, told an Oredo Magistrates Court, Benin, on Friday, May 4, that the accused committed the offence in May, 2017.

He said the accused allegedly committed the offence on May 15, 2017, at Okhoro Police Station, Benin City.

Adah added that the now suspended accused was a serving corporal then at the police station when the incident happened and the girl became pregnant.

The offence committed is contrary to Section 357 and punishable under section 358 of the Criminal Code Cap 48 Vol. II of the defunct Bendel State Laws of 1976, as applicable in Edo.

The magistrate adjourned the case to May 11 for hearing.

Meanwhile, the family of an unnamed 16-year-old girl had petitioned the Inspector General of Police, Ibrahim Idris, over allegation that one Officer Henry at the Ojo Division, Lagos state police command abducted, molested, tortured and impregnated her.

The victim’s family said the girl has since given birth to a baby five month ago, remarking that she was forced to relocate to her village in Anambra because of the incident.
