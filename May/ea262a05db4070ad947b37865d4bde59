Governor Ayodele Fayose of Ekiti Sate has expressed optimism that the Deputy Governor of the state and candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Professor Kolapo Olusola, defeat Dr. Kayode Fayemi, candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the July 14 governorship election in the state.
Fayose, after the declaration of Fayemi as winner of the APC primary election in the state on Saturday, commended APC for presenting a candidate that Ekiti people always love to vote against.
The Ekiti Governor through his twitter declared:
“I thank the APC for giving Ekiti people a candidate they love to vote against at all times. Fayemi should not celebrate this Pyrrhic victory yet because it is nothing but a flame that will be quenched on July 14. He should expect to suffer worse defeat compared to that of 2014”.
Fayose deeply throws himself into the governorship election as though he is extending his tenure.
Ironically, Fayemi had after the PDP primary on Tuesday, May 8, congratulated Olusola for his victory in the primary, commending PDP candidate’s victory “in an orderly and peaceful primary” as “a welcome development.”
The Solid Mineral Minister, thereafter, declared that APC would give the PDP candidate a good fight as “the APC still remains the preferred choice for the generality of Ekiti people.”
