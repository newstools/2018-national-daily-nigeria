In a letter dated May 28th, 2018 signed by FIBA Secretary General, Patrick Baumann and addressed to NBBF president, Engineer Musa Kida, the body reiterated unequivocally its earlier stance recognizing Kida and his board as being in charge of basketball affairs in Nigeria until such time that a new election will be held.
The letter which reads in part said, “As indicated in FIBA’s letter of 26 July, 2017, FIBA will continue to communicate solely with Mr Kida and the Board elected on 13 June, 2017 as representatives of the NBBF and as the management recognized by the Nigeria Olympic Committee.
“Consequently, until such time as there are new elections, Mr Kida and his Board shall organise all aspects (including sporting and commercial) of Nigerian Basketball’s international representation,” the letter further stated.
Reacting to the latest letter, NBBF President, Musa Kida said the federation can now focus on managing and growing the game on the domestic level as he expects that all sponsors are now expected to do the needful following the recent pronouncement by FIBA.
“It is now clear that anybody or group of people organising any competition is doing so in their personal capacity and not under the NBBF umbrella since we are the only body recognised by FIBA to present or nominate teams (clubs and national teams) for any international competition,” Kida concluded.
