North Korea on Tuesday condemned joint military exercises conducted by the United States and South Korea, and canceled a summit with South Korea scheduled for Wednesday.
North Korea cautioned that the joint military exercise is an “intentional provocation”, cautioning that a planned June 12 summit between Kim Jong UN and U.S. President, Donald Trump, could be in jeopardy.
It was gathered that the military exercises, codenamed “Max Thunder,” began on Friday; involving about 100 U.S. and South Korean warplanes, including B-52 bombers.
North Korea further cautioned the US must not insist on unilateral nuclear disarmament if the country is still interested in the summit holding as scheduled.
North Korea’s official Korean Central News Agency, which made the announcement, said: “This exercise, targeting us, which is being carried out across South Korea, is … an intentional military provocation running counter to the positive political development on the Korean Peninsula”.
