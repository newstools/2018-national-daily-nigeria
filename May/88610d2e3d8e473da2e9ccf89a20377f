The mace of the Gombe state house of assembly was stolen during plenary on Thursdayâ€“a throwback of what happened weeks ago in the Senate.
In the Gombe incident, the mace was snatched during a siting to remove Minority Leader Ahmed Haruna, who represents Gombe north state constituency.
The sergeant-at-arms of the house was overpowered by the assailant before they carried off the mace.
The incident threw the assembly into disarray, after which four APC lawmakers were suspended for four legislative days.
They were accused of being involved in the removal of the mace.
A committee was also set up to investigate the incident and report back on Monday
