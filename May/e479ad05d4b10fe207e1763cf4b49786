Following last Friday 27th April Supreme Court judgement on the leadership tussle of the Nigerian Football Federation between Chris Giwa and Amaju Pinnick led board. There have been rumours that Chris Giwa and his board members will resume at the NFF headquarter in zone 7 Abuja , BSN reports.

In a precautionary move to maintain law and order just in case any scuffle comes up 19 policemen were battle ready to forestall peace.

As at the time of writing this report the glass house remains calm, however there were  three police vans and one car that brought nineteen policemen to  maintain law and order at the NFF headquarter.

Three police vans were strategically  parked at the entrance gate with ten policemen watching everybody suspiciously. At the exit gate, strategically  situated at the back of the NFF office was one police van with nine armed  policemen.

It would be recalled that the Supreme Court judgement was interpreted in many ways which brought about confusion that led to the speculation of Mr Chris Giwa coming to take over the NFF office on Monday.
