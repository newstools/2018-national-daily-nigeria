Slovenian referee, Damir Skomina, has reportedly regretted his actions in the Champions League semifinal’s second leg between Roma and Liverpool in Rome on Wednesday night.
Trancredi Palmeri, a top Italinan reporter, said the referee was left feeling “destroyed” after the Reds knocked Roma out of the Champions League.
The Slovenian official was in the middle of the park as the Reds secured their place in the final against Real Madrid.
Despite scoring four in the Stadio Olimpico in the second leg, Roma felt aggrieved to have not netted more as they searched to overturn a 5-2 deficit from Anfield last week.
And on another night, the Italian outfit could have pulled off the remarkable comeback.
This is because a number of decisions went against Roma towards the end of the second leg.
Edin Dzeko was wrongly flagged offside before being taken down by Loris Karius in the second half, before Liverpool’s Trent Alexander-Arnold blocked a goal-bound shot with his arm on the hour mark.
And failure to get these decisions correct reportedly left Skomina ‘destroyed’ after the full-time whistle.
Palmeri, a Rome-based reporter, said, “Referee Skomina after the game in the changing room felt destroyed after realising the mistakes, admitted he was wrong.”
