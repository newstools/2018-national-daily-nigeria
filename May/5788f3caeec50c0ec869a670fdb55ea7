Choosing your baby’s name isn’t easy.
Both you and your partner have to agree (ideally). It’s nice if none of your friends or family pips you to post. Then there’s other people’s opinions.
And people ALWAYS have opinions…
So you can’t really blame someone for wanting to commemorate their child’s arrival (and name!) with a tattoo .
Unfortunately, having done this, one mum has discovered her inking is actually wrong.
Swedish newspaper, Blekinge Läns Tidning , reported that 30-year-old Johanna Giselhäll Sandström had requested a tattoo of her children’s names, Nova and Kevin.
What she got was “Nova and Kelvin”.
Johanna had a few choices.
She could either live with the typo. Or have the tattoo modified. Or go down the slightly more extreme route of changing her son’s name. Which is exactly what she did.
Of the moment she realised she’d got the wrong name imprinted on her, Johanna told Blekinge Läns Tidning: “My heart stopped and I thought I was going to faint.”
After returning to the tattoo parlour to point out the error, Johanna was given a full refund and details of a removal clinic.
The name began to grow on Johanna.
But getting a tattoo removed isn’t a simple or quick process, and in the meantime, Johanna started to come around to the name “Kelvin”.
We decided to rename the boy,” she adds. And three years on, everyone is happy.
Johanna has since had a daughter, Freja, and insists she’ll be double-checking the tattoo artist’s work for her name.
