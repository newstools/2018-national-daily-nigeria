Efforts of Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo to resolve the crisis rocking the Imo state chapter of the All Progressive Congress (APC) have ended in a deadlock.
Saturday’s election was marred with violence as thugs attacked the party’s secretariat in the state and made away with some materials meant for the congress.
Okorocha personally informed President Muhammadu Buhari over the crisis, and the president promised the issues will be addressed.
On Thursday, Osinbajo held separate meetings with the two groups–the Okoracha faction and his deputy Eze Madumare’s, but both still stood their grounds.
While Okorocha said a new ward congress would hold, Madumere insisted his group had been able to convince Osinbajo that congress held on Saturday.
Present at the meetng were Madumere, Ifeanyi Ararume Osita Izunaso, Benjamin Umajumogu and Theodore Ekechi.
Okorocha’s group would later come into Aso Rock, squired by Uche Nwosu, his son-in-law anointed as his successor.
