The All Progressives Congress governorship candidate in Ekiti State, Dr. Kayode Fayemi says he has uncovered plot by the governor of Ekiti state, Ayodele Fayose to cause disharmony within members of the APC in the state.
In a statement released on Saturday by Yinka Oyebode, spokesman of Fayemi, the minister alleged that Fayose has hired thugs pretending to work for him to carry out attacks on supporters of Segun Oni, a former governor of the state.
Recalls that Segun Oni who was the first runner up at the just concluded APC governorship primary had threatened to dump the party over what he described as maltreatment of his supporters after Fayemi emerged as the APC candidate for the governorship election scheduled for July.
Oyebode called on security agencies to take note of the alleged plan.
“The Kayode Fayemi Campaign Office has uncovered a clandestine plan by Governor Ayodele Fayose and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to carry out coordinated attacks on supporters and associates of former Governor Segun Oni, using thugs who would pretend to be working for Dr Kayode Fayemi, minister of mines and steel development and candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC),” the statement read.
“It was reliably gathered that the plan, which had reached advanced stage, was designed by Governor Fayose as part of the efforts to cause disharmony among the two former governors of the state as well as their supporters.
“According to information, the assailants would carry out the dastardly act, wearing JKF branded materials and making insinuations that would establish a possible link to the Fayemi political camp.”
He urged members and supporters of the APC to shun any form of violence during the electioneering period.
“The campaign office reiterates the position of the APC leadership that all members of the party should unite and work together for the success of the APC in the coming elections,” it read.
