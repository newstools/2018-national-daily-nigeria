Former warlords and ex-agitators in the Niger Delta have pledged to work with the federal government ensure free and fair elections in the region in 2019 and beyond.
The leaders met in Lagos with Special Adviser to President on Niger Delta and Coordinator of the Presidential Amnesty programme Charles Dokubo on weekend.
Amongst them were Bibopre Ajube, aka General Shoot-at-Sight; Victor Ben, alias Boyloaf, and HRH Ateke Tom, among others.
There were also representatives of other frontline leaders of ex-agitators in the Niger Delta, including Government Ekpemupolo alias Tompolo.
The oik-rich region is politically dominated by the opposition PDP across the six states in the geo-political zone.
The ex-militant pledging allegiance to the APC federal government could have a lot of political implication come 2019.
Dokubo’s Special Assistant Murphy Ganagana, in a statement, said the representatives made a point of the ommission of the ex-agitators in government appointment, which they believe is important for sustainable peace in the region.
“If you want peace, this needs to be corrected,” the said.
“We are ready to make peace in our kingdoms. But how can we keep the peace when you don’t make provisions for leaders of the ex-agitators?”
By Dokubo’s appointment, the federal government is expecting all Niger Delta people to come together and support it, the group said, promising to support the adviser.
Richard Akinaka, who represented Ateke Tom, said the people of Rivers State, particularly the Okrika ethnic group, identify with Dokubo’s vision, and are ready to align with the Amnesty Programme.
Dokubo was appointed after President Muhammadu Buhari fired retired Brog.-Gen. Paul Boroh accused of stealing millions from the amnesty programme.
