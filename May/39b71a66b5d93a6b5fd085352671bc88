Embattled senator representing Ogun east, Buruji Kashamu may likely be in for a fresh legal action for his extradition to the United States following the resolve of the federal government to initiate a fresh suit.

The move is coming after the appeal court set aside a restraining order Kashamu had obtained against the federal government and its agencies.

The appeal court on May 3 held that the senator could be arrested if he had a case to answer. The court said Kashamu could not back up his claim that some unnamed persons were trying to abduct him.

National Daily gathered with the judgement of the court of appeal, the coast is now clear to file fresh extradition proceedings if the United States government makes a fresh request.

The senator is alleged to have been involved in drug activities in the US.

According to source, the US government has been told to make a fresh request for the senator after the former extradition proceedings were dismissed.

The source told National Daily that they had been waiting for the orders hindering the extradition to be set aside by the appellate court.

“With the judgment of the court of appeal now, we would have just revived the former proceedings but since the case was not just struck out but dismissed by the federal high court, it means the process must start afresh.”
 
The source was quoted to have said Kashamu’s appeal of the court judgement would not stop “extradition proceedings once everything needed to set it in motion is ready”.
