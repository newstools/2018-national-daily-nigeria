The family of the late General Secretary of the Christian Association of Nigeria Musa Asake have rejected the befitting funeral the association is planning for the cleric.
The Asakes expressed their feelings in a letter dated May 23 2018, and signed by Asake’s first son Aminchi.
“I want to thank the Christian Association of Nigeria for reaching out to my family and wanting to commiserate with us on the passing on of my father. You have been so generous as to offer us assistance with the planning of his burial, even planning a service of songs and a commendation service,” the letter read.
“But at this point, I must ask CAN to stop, we do not need your assistance.”
“The family has taken an independent decision that we will be solely responsible for the burial of our father, late Rev. Dr. Musa Asake. We have already set up an independent committee and will proceed accordingly with our plans. Thank you.”
The letter was addressed to CAN’s Assistant General Secretary Joseph Bade Daramola.
A day before, CAN had set up a burial committee chaired by Rev. Stephen Adegbite “to organise a befitting farewell” for its late 66-year-old general secretary.
But the rejection might be related to the indifference and position-seeking that immediately blew out among CAN’s leaders after Asake died May 11.
The President of CAN, Dr. Samson Ayokunle, was said to have travelled to Philadelphia, U.S few hours after Asake death.
And hours after Asake passed on, some senior officers of CAN reportedly asked his personal pssistant to surrender the keys to Asake’s office.
No official statement yet from CAN after the Asakes rejected its offer.
Asake will be buried on Friday June 8 2018.
