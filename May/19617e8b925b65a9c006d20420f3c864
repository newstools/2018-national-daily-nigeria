Real Madrid have received a massive boost with the news Cristiano Ronaldo’s ankle injury will not jeopardise his chances of playing in the Champions League final.
He was forced off at half-time of the Clasico clash with Barcelona, prompting fears he could miss the showpiece meeting with Liverpool in Kiev on May 26.

He will, however, be sidelined for the next two matches — at Sevilla and at home against Celta Vigo — before returning for the final La Liga clash of the season away to Villarreal.
