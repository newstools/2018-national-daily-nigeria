MTN, telecommunications giant, on Monday, paid N500, 000 to one of its customers, Oluwole Aluko, in compliance with a federal high court judgement.
Aluko, a legal practitioner, had in 2016 sued MTN, alleging unlawful deduction of his call credit.
In 2017, Nathaniel Ayo-Emmanuel, the judge of the federal high court, Ibadan, entered judgement in favour of the claimant when there was no representation for MTN throughout the hearing period until the judgement day.
But Abiola Olagunju and Fatimah Tiamiyu later announced their representation for MTN, with an application asking the court to set aside its judgement against their client.
They had argued that the company’s legal department was never aware of the suit against the company before the court.
Aluko, however, presented before the court, evidences of court summons served on the defendants with proof of receipt in a criminal contempt suit he instigated against the duo.
He had argued that the duo was trying to pervert the course of justice.
At the resumed hearing on Monday, Aluko informed the court that MTN had paid him N500, 000 in compliance with the court’s earlier order.
