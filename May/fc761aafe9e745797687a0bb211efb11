Liverpool winger, Mohammed Salah, has insisted he is going nowhere this summer.
Salah was crowned the Reds’ Player of the Season at a glittering awards ceremony on Thursday evening.
Speaking after the event, he said he was desperate to be part of a new era of Anfield glory.
The Egypt international has been heavily linked with a move to Real Madrid, but he has now assured the club’s supporters he is staying.
“I’m very happy here and everything is fine.
“I have got ambitions for the future, with ­Liverpool.
“We had a great season and now we are in the Champions League final, and everyone is excited. It is just the start. This is my first year here and it is the same for some other players.
“We have had an unbelievable year. It is just the beginning,” he said.
Salah picked up both the First Team Players’ Player of the Season, the Standard Chartered Player of the Season award and the Football Writers Association award
