A legal practitioner and Director of Strategic Communications of the President Muhammadu Buhari Presidential Campaign Organization, Festus Keyamo SAN, on Thursday, articulated that the 2019 general elections is “a battle between forces of darkness and light”.
Keyamo on his Twitter handle maintained that the elections would be “between the tin gods of Nigeria and the masses; between the forces of corruption and patriots.”
He explained that if the 2019 elections were just a contest for power, people like him would not come out of their comfort zone to participate.
Keyamo was appointed on the board of the Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation on May 8 by President Muhammadu Buhari, along with six other APC members.
He is to represent Delta State on the board.
The Minister of Transportation and Director General, Muhammadu Buhari Presidential Campaign Organisation, on April 17 communicated a letter wherein Keyamo was appointed the Director, Strategic Communications for Buhari’s 2019 presidential campaigns.
Accordingly, the legal practitioner would have resumed duty appropriately.
