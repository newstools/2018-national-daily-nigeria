A Magistrate Court sitting in Ubiaja, Esan South East LGA, Edo State, on Thursday, convicted two transformer vandals, Mohammed Dan Fulani, 27 and Babangida Aliyu, 29, to one month and two weeks imprisonment, respectively, with hard labour for vandalizing a Benin Electricity Distribution Plc (BEDC) transformer.
The two vandals were arraigned on a two count charge of “malicious damage and stealing” and pleaded guilty to the charges at the Benin Magistrate Court before Justice N, B, Edogun.
A similar incident occurred in Ubiaja, a year ago when one Osifo Peter was arrested and prosecuted for vandalizing BEDC substation.
In a related development, another vandal has been arrested for vandalizing BEDC substation in Ugbalo in Esan Central LGA, of the state. The Police are still investigating the case.
It will be recalled that the activities of vandals on electricity distribution network has been a major act negatively affecting power service delivery to customers, a consideration that made BEDC to recently partner with a security agency; Operation Thunderstorm in Benin; a Nigerian army outfit set up in support of civil authorities to maintain law and order in Edo State.
The partnership was geared towards strengthening the operation of the squad to enable it fight power equipment vandals as a bold step towards the arrest and persecution of these miscreants.
The war against vandalism recorded a major boost recently when one John Joshua (25 years) and Yakubu Irish, also aged 28 years old, were apprehended by community members while vandalizing a transformers at Idahagbon community, off Oko central Road, Benin city, Edo State.
The two vandals caught in the act by members of Idahagbon community were sentenced to six months of imprisonment after arraignment on a two count charge of “malicious damage and stealing” at Oredo Magistrate Court before Chief Magistrate I.U Iyoha (Mrs).
