9Mobile, the under pressure telecoms operator, is in trouble again and this time with the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) for allegedly violating the regulators rules by running promotion without approval.
 According to the first quarter enforcement and compliance monitoring report on the Commission’s website, 9mobile was carrying out a “ZTE Mf910 4G Mifi Promotion” in which it promised that customers who purchased a 9mobile ZTE MF910 4G mifi device at N18,800 would enjoy 10GB free data valid for 30 days.
 “Accordingly, we carried out compliance checks in line with the Commission’s Guidelines on Advertisements and Promotions. Having confirmed that the promotion has not been approved by the Commission, it was recommended that 9Mobile be sanctioned for the violation” the report stated.
In addition, the regulator has also queried the telco over its Samsung S9/S9+ promotion, noting that it slightly deviated from what was approved by the Commission.
 “Having reviewed the features of the offer approved by the Commission viz-a-viz what is being advertised by 9mobile, the unit observed a slight departure from the Commission’s approval. In addition, 9mobile failed to communicate the conditions of the promotion in clear and understandable terms contrary to Section 4 (xv) of the Commission’s Guidelines on Advertisements and Promotions. Consequently, the case was transferred to Enforcement Unit for necessary action.”
 The company, which is currently under interim management, has been facing several challenges since 2017, when a consortium of bank attempted a forceful take-over over an unpaid loan.
The incident led to the United Arab Emirate’s Etisalat pulling out of the business and its name was eventually changed to 9Mobile.
However, the process of selling 9Mobile to new investors who would reposition it is also being marred in controversies.
