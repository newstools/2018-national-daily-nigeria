Ekiti Deputy Governor Kolapo Olusola has floored his rival Dayo Adeyeye in the guber primary election the PDP conducted Tuesday.
He polled 1,191 to defeat the former minister of state for works, who is also a former national publicity secretary of the PDP Caretaker Committee.
Adeyeye scored 770 in spite of the third contestant Sen. Abiodun Olujimi stepping down and joining forces with him.
He left the venue before result was announced, though he was said to have confided in the election committee he accepted the result.
No fewer than 1, 968 delegates were accredited for voting whic started at 2:10 pm under tight security.
Unlike the APC, there was no incident of violence n the election whose committee was chaired by Delta Gov. Ifeanyi Okowa.
Olujimi commended Okowa for bringing experience to bear on the primary.
“We are pleased that there is a very wide opportunity for transparency. We will be pleased with the result because we have done our best,” she said.
She, however, hinted that the winner was forced on them.
“We had a party where we didn’t have a voice, where everything was lorded over us.
“We needed to take the party back to the people and the only way we can do this is not to have an anointed candidate.”
Olusola is the anointed candidate of Gov. Ayo Fayose who had been in conflict with Olujimi and Adeyeye before the primary.
But the senator said she would reconsider her stand if Olusola won.
Governor Fayose also commended the election’s committee for doing a good job. He also commended Adeyeye and Olujimi for their spirit of sportsmanship.
“I thank Prince Adeyeye and Senator Olujimi for their courage,” he said.
“I will reach out to Prince Adeyeye and Senator Olujimi and personally visit them. I appeal to them in the overall interest of the party to work for our common goal.”
