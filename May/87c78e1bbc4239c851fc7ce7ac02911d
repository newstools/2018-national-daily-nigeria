Cristiano Ronaldo claims his Real Madrid future will not be determined by money or glory after hinting that he could make a move away from the Santiago Bernabeu,National Daily learnt.
While the five-time Ballon d’Or winner was kept relatively quiet during Madrid’s Champions League final victory over Liverpool on Saturday, the Portuguese ensured that he dominated the post-match headlines.
Amid talk of a possible return to Manchester United or a lucrative switch to China, the 33-year-old forward said, as quoted by Marca: “Money is not the problem.
“I have won five Champions Leagues and five Ballons d’Or. I had already made history, but now even more.
“I’m not upset because I know what I give to the club. I don’t want to erase this unique moment, with my colleagues who are champions.
“I cannot guarantee anything. I’m not going to hide, in the next few days I’ll talk… Life is not just about glory.”
