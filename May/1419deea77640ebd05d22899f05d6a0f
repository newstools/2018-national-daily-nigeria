A Kogi State High Court has ordered the police to move in their custody to the National Hospital, Abuja.
The trial judge also adjourned till Monday, 7th, May for continuation of hearing in a written bail application filed by Melaye’s counsel Mike Ozekhome, SAN, asking for a variation of the remand order placed on him.
Melaye was on Thursday denied bail by Senior Magistrates’ Court sitting in Lokoja which heard a seven-count charge bordering on criminal conspiracy and illegal possession of fire arms brought against him.
Kogi’s Chief Justice Nadir Ajanah, who presided over the proceedings on Friday, said that in view of the critical health conditions as espoused by the counsel to the applicant, he should be moved to the National Hospital, Abuja, for proper medical attention.
Ozekhome had argued that Melaye was a chronic asthmatic patient who gasped for breath on Thursday while being arraigned and had to be given his special inhaler right there in the courtroom and in the presence of the trial magistrate, Sulyman Abdalah.
The counsel said the judge was convinced beyond all reasonable doubts that the Police Clinic facilities in Lokoja could not meet Melaye’s medical needs.
“He also recognised the fact that as a senator of the Federal Republic, Dino cannot abandon his legislative duties and jump bail.
“Apart from this, his passport and other travel documents are in the possession of the police, which makes it impossible to leave the country,” Ozekhome added.
Melaye’s ordeal began weeks ago on his way to a national assignment in Morocco–when he was flagged down by the Nigeria Immigration Service.
The police would later lay siege to his Abuja home until he surrendered after 20 hours.
