The National Universities Commission (NUC) has warned candidates to stay clear off 58 universities which the commission described as illegal.
In a bulleting dated May 14 and made available to National Daily, the commission said the universities are operating illegally in the country, adding that certificates obtained from any of the institutions are invalid.
“For the avoidance of doubt, anybody who patronises or obtains any certificate from any of these illegal institutions does so at his or her own risk,” the publication read.
The commission said certificates obtained from the institutions will not be recognised for the purposes of National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), employment and further studies.
It also called on the relevant law enforcement agencies to take necessary action.
