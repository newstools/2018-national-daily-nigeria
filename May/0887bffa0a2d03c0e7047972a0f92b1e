Perennial Enugu state Federation cup champions and seven time Nigerian league champions, Rangers International F.C at the weekend surrendered the trophy they were defending to national armature side, Crime Busters F.C who inflicted a painful 2-1 victory over the defending champions at the main bowl of Nnamdi Azikiwe stadium, ‘The Cathedral’,National Daily learnt.
It was really a bad day at the office for the coach Olugbenga Ogunbote’ wards. Despite taking an early lead through a connecting header by returnee, Uche Nwofor, who nodded past Nnabugwu Emeka after Bright Silas’ inch perfect cross fell kindly for the former Super Eagles to score, they could not contain their more determined opponents.
Late efforts by Rangers to wrestle the chest-nut out of the burning fire did not yield any dividend as the backline of the armature side did not give away any ground while the few chance that came were thrown away.
Despite the loss, the third time since 1991, Rangers still qualified to take part in the 2018 national Aiteo cup as both teams had earlier picked the tickets to represent the state at the oldest club football competition in the country.
S.P Ebere Amarizu, Manager of Crime Busters F.C said, “We worked for it and desired it more and we got the reward for our painstaking efforts. Self motivation and determination gave us the victory and we are taking this to the national level. We are going to defend the state very well.”
Coach Olugbenga Ogunbote of Rangers said, “It is shocking but that is the beauty of the game. We paid for our poor finishing but I believe we shall get it right at the national finals.”
