Arsenal fans are disappointed in Gunners players and Arsene Wenger following the club’s 1-0 defeat to Atletico Madrid in the Europa League semi-final second leg tie on Thursday night.
Arsene Wenger’s men had drew 1-1 in the first leg last week in England and were not the favourites going into the leg at the Wanda Metropolitano.
Diego Costa’s 53rd minute strike where he held off the challenge of Hector Bellerin to coolly slot past goalkeeper David Ospina was the only goal of the night in the Spanish capital as Diego Simeone’s men qualified for the final with a 2-1 aggregates.
Arsenal will not be playing in the Champions League next season after they were knocked out of the Europa League by Atletico.
However, Some Arsenal fans have taken to their Twitter accounts to express their disappointment.
