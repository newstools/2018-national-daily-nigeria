Jack Wilshere was left out of England’s World Cup squad this week with Gareth Southgate reportedly concerned about his fitness levels.
Having stayed available for most of the season this decision seemed to be about his ability to play the kind of game the England manager wants, but when your team includes Eric Dier it’s hard to make a case that Wilshere wouldn’t have added something to the 23 man panel.
It’s a disappointment for the 26 year old, still yet to sign a new deal with Arsenal, and he had his say on the matter yesterday via his Twitter account.
“And given the chance I could have made a real impact. However, I have to respect the manager’s decision and would like to wish the whole squad all the very best for the tournament.
“I will always be an England fan and will be supporting the boys with the rest of the nation.”
Danny Welbeck is the only Arsenal man in the England squad, while Alexandre Lacazette could only make the stand-by squad for France despite finishing the season well.
