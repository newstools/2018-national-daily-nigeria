Former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar promises better governance in his race for the exalted office in the Presidential Villa, Abuja.
At a symposium and inauguration of the Atiku Mandate Group, code named TAM-G in Lagos, represented by the National President and Chairman of the All Atiku Support Groups, Oladimeji Fabiyi, the former vice president emphasized that his primary objective is to put Nigeria back on the path of economic prosperity. He maintained that he is running for the office of the President in 2019 not for selfish reasons but for the survival of Nigeria.
He reiterated that besides job opportunities and wealth creation, he would focus his campaign on uniting Nigerians who had been sharply divided along ethnic lines in recent time.
“My decision to vie for the President of Nigeria is borne out of genuine desire to serve the people of Nigeria and to help bring the country back to the path of economic growth for the greater good of all Nigerians.
“The 2019 presidential election is not about me as a person but for the survival of Nigeria.
“The Atiku campaign mantra will focus on the acronym (JOBS), which literally means creating jobs for the teeming majority of unemployed Nigerian youths; creating opportunities and the enabling environment for Nigerians to excel in their individual endeavours; reconciling and uniting Nigerians and creating a sense of belonging among all the ethnic groups in the country; and providing adequate and enduring security for lives and property of all Nigerians at all levels,” he declared.
Atiku appealed to Nigerian women to align with his Presidency project, describing the women as nation-builders who must be recognised and given their rightful place in the country.
