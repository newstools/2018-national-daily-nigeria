Sign Netflix deal to produce films




Former President of the United States of America, Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, have expanded the entertainment industry in the US dominated by the Hollywood actors by joining the industry for film production. Accordingly, the Obama dynasty may be completing its retirement from the White House after eight years of presidential two tenures into entertainers in the US. Accordingly, they signed a deal with Netflix, an American entertainment company that provides streaming media, video-on-demand online, and DVD by mail, to produce films, documentaries and other types of series, for their new career.
“President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama have entered into a multi-year agreement to produce films and series for Netflix, potentially including scripted series, unscripted series, docu-series, documentaries, and features,” Netflix tweeted on Monday.
Netflix Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos said he was incredibly proud the Obamas “have chosen to make Netflix the home for their formidable storytelling abilities.”
