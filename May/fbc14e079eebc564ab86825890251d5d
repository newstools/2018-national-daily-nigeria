The Bayelsa State Police Command has decried the increasing public procession and blockage of access roads by agitators, interest groups, communities and protesters without formal notifications or approval from the relevant authority thereby denying access to other users of public space.
DSP Asinim Butswat, Police Public Relations Officer, Bayelsa State Command, Yenagoa, in a statement, remarked that, “this conduct is not only illegal but has the potential for miscreants and undesirable elements in the society to take undue advantage to pose threat to lives and property.”
The Command, however, recognized the constitutional rights of law abiding citizens for processions, picketing or other forms of protest but advocated that these rights must be exercised within the confines of the law. The Command promised it will process and provide security cover for any legitimate procession or public protest, which they said, is part of democratic policing.
The Command, therefore, warned all those involved in the unwholesome practices to stop forthwith and desist from acts which will likely give rise to invitation of hoodlums and never do wells that are looking for the slightest opportunity to disrupt the harmony and tranquility of the State.
The Command further admonished that they will not hesitate to visit the full weight of the law on any individual or group of persons that takes law into his or her hands.
The Bayelsa Command, therefore, sought the cooperation of the good people of Bayelsa State to be law abiding and to report any suspicious movement of persons to the nearest police station.
“Bayelsans must never allow the peace and security in the State to be disrupted.  The Command is fully prepared and motivated to protect life and property and deal with mischief makers decisively in accordance to the law,” the Police declared.
