The All Progressives Congress (APC) after a stakeholders meeting on Tuesday on the obstructed inconclusive primary election on Saturday, May 5, to elect the party’s candidate for the July governorship election in Ekiti State,  declared that supporters of the aspirants involved in the disruption of the primary have been disqualified from participating in the rescheduled election.
APC National Publicity Secretary, Bolaji Abdullahi, after the meeting absolved the NWC from complicity or sentiments in handling the Ekiti primary election, saying that certain adjustments have been made that the conspiracy theory does not stand. He stated that the time is too short for unnecessary details, adding that the party needs to meet with the time for the presentation of a candidate in the July 14 governorship election.
Abdullahi had on Monday threatened that aspirants involved in the obstruction of the last Saturday primary election may be disqualified. The APC image handler remarked that the perpetrators of the violence at the primary were identifiable from reports on the electronic media. However, the Publicity Secretary failed to announce the disqualification of any aspirant; rather, actions were taken on their supporters who participated in the process as observers.
