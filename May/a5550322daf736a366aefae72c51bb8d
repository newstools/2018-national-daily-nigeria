As the embattled senator resumes sitting




The Senate has succumbed to the intimidation of Senator Ovie Omo-Agege, representing Delta Central Senatorial District in the National Assembly after he threatened that the appeal filed by the Senate and the Senate President cannot stop him from resuming legislative duties on Tuesday. the Chairman, Senate Committee on Media and Publicity, Senator Sabi Aliyu Abdullahi, in a statement on Monday, indicated that the senate cannot stop the embattled senator from returning duties when plenary resumes Tuesday,
“The Senate leadership has been briefed by our lawyers on last Thursday judgement of the Federal High Court, Abuja, on whether the Senate has the legal authority to suspend a member for certain misconduct or not.
“We have equally filed an appeal against the judgement of the court and a motion for stay of execution of the judgement at the Court of Appeal.
“As an institution that obeys the law and court orders, the Senate has decided that it will comply with the judgement of the Federal High Court and do nothing to stop Senator Ovie Omo-Agege from resuming in his office and at plenary from tomorrow May 15, 2018, pending the determination of the application for stay of execution.
“The Senate has been advised that since the motion for stay of execution of the Thursday (May 10, 2018) judgement shall be heard and possibly determined on Wednesday, May 16, 2018, we shall therefore respect the subsisting High Court judgement and await the appellate court decision on the pending motion,” the senate declared.
the senate had suspended Omo-Agege on April 12, 2018 over his stamen that amendment of the Electoral Act and the alteration of the INEC 2019 elections timetable were targeting the president. He was further admonished the suit in court seeking protection against his suspension by the senate. However, a Federal High Court in Abuja, last week upturned his 90 days suspension by the senate, ordering his immediate resumption.
The senator following the judgment dared the senate that the pending appeal at the Court of Appeal cannot stop him from resuming legislative duties this week.
