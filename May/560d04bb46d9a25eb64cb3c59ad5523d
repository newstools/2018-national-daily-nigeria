The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Edo State has protested the obstruction of the judicial process relating to the granting of bail of some PDP leaders in the state. the governor is being accused of issuing instructions to the state’s Ministry of Lands not to verify PDP leaders bail documents to enable them meet the conditions given by the court.
Chris Osa Nehikhare, State Publicity Secretary,  PDP Edo  State, in a statement on Friday, raised alarm that since 8.00am  this Friday, Edo State Government has refused to sign all documents for Edo PDP leaders bail, for obvious political differences.
He protested that, “acting on the instructions of Governor Godwin Obaseki, all the documents relating to the verification were locked up in Hon. Evboumwan’s office. This obvious action to deny us Justice is malicious and an infantile and irresponsible political vendetta.”
The PDP leaders, therefore, condemned Edo State Government’s decision to play politics with peoples rights.
The PDP leaders assured all party members that the party leaders in this unjust captivity are in good spirits, noting that, “they urge you to remain steadfast and committed to the just course of mobilising to vote out APC in the next coming elections.”
Nehikhare decried: “As it is becoming obvious that they will not do the needful, they have elected to sign only that of Chief Lucky Imasuen because of his current membership of APC. Lucky Imasuen has insisted that his own cannot be separated from the rest of those charged with him.”
He advocated that APC should fight corruption and not Opposition.
