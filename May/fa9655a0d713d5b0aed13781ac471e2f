A suspected cultist, among dozens of other criminals paraded on Wednesday by the Ogun State Police Command, has confessed to killing one member of a rival cult, and trading his hands.
Twenry-seven year-old Kayode Oreneye was said to have chopped off his victim Shakiru’s two hands, and sold them for N5,000 to a herbalist.
Oraneye claimed he is a member of the Aiye Confraternity while Shakiru belonged to Eiye.
He was paraded with other 47 suspected criminals who were arrested for offences ranging from armed robbery and murder to stealing and ritual killings, among others.
They were paraded at the command headquarters, Eleweran, Abeokuta, by the state Commissioner of Police, Ahmed Iliyasu.
Oreneye, a father of two, told journalists that the late victim the had attempted to kill him on three occasions.
But Shakiru had earlier killed three members of the Aiye cult before Oreneye shot and killed him at Library Junction, Ilaro, on February 12, 2018, in a reprisal.
‘I had to quickly strike before he could strick again.”
Iliyasu told journalists that the suspect was arrested at a drinking joint in Oke Ilewo, Abeokuta.
Another alleged cult leader, Gbenga Ogunsanya, popularly known as Spartacus, was also paraded with another member of his gang, one Quam Olubodun.
Iliyasu said 23-year-old Ogunsanya and members of his gang killed more than nine persons.
Ogunsanya, high school drop out , said he also belonged to the Aiye cult, and he moved around the city of Abeokuta with a gang of 30 members, all armed with different weapons.
He was arrested on March 12, 2018, by men of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad, barely a year after he joined the group.
Recovered from the cult members were one pump-action gun, one cut-to-size locally-made pistol, five live cartridges and assorted charms.
