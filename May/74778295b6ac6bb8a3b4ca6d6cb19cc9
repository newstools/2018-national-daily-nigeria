Mohamed Salah has broken his silence after leaving the pitch in tears following Sergio Ramos’s challenge during the Champions League final.
The Egyptian took to Twitter and said: “It was a very tough night, but I’m a fighter. Despite the odds, I’m confident that I’ll be in Russia to make you all proud. Your love and support will give me the strength I need.”
Without their star striker the Reds slumped to a 3-1 defeat, largely due to two catastrophic goalkeeping errors from Lloris Karius.
But it wasn’t just Liverpool fans heartbroken by Salah’s injury as Egyptian supporters were devastated by what appeared to be a savage blow to their World Cup ambitions.
Salah’s optimistic tweet will no doubt brighten the mood among fans. The 25-year-old will be attempting rapid rehabilitation of the shoulder with the World Cup kicking off in 15 days.
Whether the Premier League Player of the Year can be healthy in time remains to be seen but the coming days will reveal the severity of his shoulder injury and his chances of making thexxx global showpiece.
