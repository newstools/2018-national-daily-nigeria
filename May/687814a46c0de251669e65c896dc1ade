Following a scoreless first half, Nigeria’s two –goal hero in the first –leg, Wasiu Alalade was badly impaired in the penalty box in the 58th minute, presenting team-mate Adamu Alhassan the opportunity to blast home for the only goal of the match. With both teams having settled for a 2-2 draw in Bissau eight days ago, aggregate scoreline stood at 3-2 in the Flying Eagles’ favour.
