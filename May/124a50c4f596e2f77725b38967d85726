Nigerian Soldiers on Tuesday arrested leader of the Biafra Nations Youth League (BNYL) in Bakassi, Cross River State. BNYL Secretariat  condemned the action of the Niegrian Army in the arrest of its members, including the Chief of Staff of the Organization, Mr Linus Essien, in Bakassi. The BNYL Secretariat narrated that the members were on their way to Anambra State to participate in the 51st anniversary of the Declaration of Biafra holding this Wednesday, May 30, 2018.
National Leader of BNYL, Princewill Richard, said that the information of the arrest was received at about 7.00pm on Tuesday.
Princewill Richard wondered how an event that was not held in Bakassi would become a threat to security agencies in the area.
“They have been threatening us on phone since we made public our intention to participate in the Biafra memorial day; that is act of kidnapping, a criminal act, so to say,” the  BNYL National Leader declared.
He, therefore, called for the immediate release of the members arrested along with the front line Bakassi Leader.
