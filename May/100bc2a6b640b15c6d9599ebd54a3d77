A chairmanship candidate, Jeremiah Oghoveta, was stabbed to death at the All Progressives Congress ward congresses in Ughelli South Local Government Area (LGA), Delta State, on Saturday.
The Delta Police Command confirmed that a chairmanship candidate died in the APC ward congresses in Ughelli South Local Government Area (LGA). The police spokesman, Andrew , acknowledged that Jeremiah Oghoveta, was stabbed to death during the exercise at Jeremi Ward 3, Okwagbe.
It was gathered that the deceased was stabbed to death by an APC member, Tete Pippah.
Pippah was said to have attacked Ogheveta during an argument that ensued when the deceased accused him of hijacking the electoral materials meant for the congresses in the area.
The deceased and the alleged assailant were said to belong to different factions of APC in the area.
There were reported cases of ballot-box snatching during voting at Ogor and Orogun Wards 1 and 2, respectively, in Ughelli North LGA.
It was gathered that officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) were not present for the exercise in Ward 5, Ovu in Ethiope LGA.
APC leaders in the ward were said to have resolved to conduct the election for the candidates, adopting Option A4 after waiting in vain for the INEC officials.
One of the three contestants for the chairmanship reportedly stepped down, leaving the contest for the other two candidates.
