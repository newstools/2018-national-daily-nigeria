The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) says  Nigeria may be doomed if Leah Sharibu, the only christian girl still in Book Haram captivity dies.





Sharibu, who turned 15 on Monday, was the only Christian girl among the 112 kidnapped girlsl Technical College, Dapchi, Yobe state, by Boko Haram insurgents on February 19.
While most of the other girls later regained freedom, Sharibu was held back for allegedly refusing to denounce her faith.
Speaking on Saturday, Adebayo Oladeji, Special Assistant on Media and Communications to the CAN president, said Leah Sharibu must not die, because her death in captivity  could spell doom for Nigeria.
He said her death could give an open invitation to religious war because Leah is being detained purely because of her religion.
“Recently, CAN called out its members to demand for her release. We have addressed a press conference calling for her release. At every opportunity any church leader has to speak to the public, they demand her release.
“We are doing a lot of things we cannot be disclosing to the public. Our concern includes the silence of the media and the civil society organisations thinking Leah Sharibu is a CAN affair. How many editorials have been written about her plight?
“CAN will not cease the agitation for the release of all the abductees, including Leah Sharibu. Let all and sundry rise up against the failure of the security agencies and ask President Muhammadu Buhari to wake up from his slumber before the terrorists and herdsmen finish the country,” he said.
