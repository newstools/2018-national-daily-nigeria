Adam Lallana is so desperate to secure a place on the plane to Russia that he will report back to England training a week early to prove his fitness to Gareth Southgate, according to reports.
The Liverpool midfielder has only started three matches all season as his campaign was destroyed by injuries but Lallana, who is on the standby list for the World Cup, is determined to show he is ready.
The Daily Mail claims that Lallana wants to prove that he should be first choice back-up after not being named in England’s 23-man squad and will turn up for training early this week.
Southgate has given Liverpool players the week off after their efforts in their Champions League final loss to Real Madrid on Saturday.
And, despite coming on early in the match to replace Mohamed Salah, Lallana has no interest in taking the week off.
Lallana’s team-mates, Jordan Henderson and Trent Alexander-Arnold, are set to join up with the rest of the squad over the weekend.
The former Southampton midfielder is likely to have a better chance than most on the back-up list due to his versatility and Southgate is known to be a big fan of his.
