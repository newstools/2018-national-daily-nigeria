The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), on Sunday, rejected Timi Frank, the party’s suspended Deputy National Publicity Secretary, as a chieftain of the party. The party unequivocally declared that Timi frank is not a ‘chieftain’ of the party.
Mallam Bolaji Abdullahi, APC National Publicity Secretary, in a statement on Sunday declared: “Our attention has been drawn to a report on the online newspaper, thecable.ng in which one Timi Frank was addressed as a ‘Chieftain’ of the All Progressives Congress (APC).
“We wish to correct the wrong designation and remind the newspaper and indeed the general public that Timi Frank has since November 2016 been suspended as a member of the APC following a recommendation of an APC disciplinary committee and subsequent ratification by the Party’s South South Zonal Executive Committee.
“Hence, whatever position Timi Frank holds or canvasses is done in his personal capacity and has no bearing on the APC.”
Timi Frank was reported to have made a statement, commending the leadership of former President Goodluck Jonathan and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), while simultaneously, criticizing the leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari and the government of the All Progressives Congress (APC). The statement provoked the reaction of the APC leadership. However, APC seem to forget that Timi Frank has not been expelled from the party, the major disciplinary action that exclude him from the membership of the ruling APC; suspension only limits his activities in the party and does not disqualify him as an APC chieftain, having held an executive position.
