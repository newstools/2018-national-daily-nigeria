One person was reportedly shot dead on Saturday as the All Progressives Congress (APC) congress in Lagos state turned violent.
According to findings by National Daily, the exercise was going on smoothly at Central School, Dopemu, until suspected thugs invaded the area, shooting sporadically into the air.
The shootings had resulted in chaos in the area as participants in the congress scurried to safety.
The thugs were said to have killed one Nurudeen Olanose while an unconfirmed number of persons were injured.
The police say three persons have been arrested over their alleged involvement in the killing.
Chike Oti, spokesman of the command, said the suspects have been taken to the criminal investigation department, Panti, for interrogation.
He said: “We confirmed that one person was killed on Saturday at Central Primary School, Oniwaya Agege. Three persons allegedly involved in the killing have been arrested.
“The suspects have been taken to the State Criminal Investigation Department, Panti for interrogations. The victim was killed outside the venue of the APC ward election.
“The victims and those arrested had nothing to do with the election as they were not accredited.”
In a similar development, the congress in Ifako-Ijaiye local government area was brought to an abrupt end as a mild violence erupted over the choice of candidates.
Trouble started when the electoral officers announced some names as elected executive members after which some party members immediately protested in opposition.
The intervention of security personnel on ground prevented a breakdown of law and order.
The electoral officers in charge of the process were whisked away by security officials after some persons attempted to attack them.
