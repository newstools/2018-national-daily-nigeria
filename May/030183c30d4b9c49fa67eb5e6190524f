Embattled Senator Dino Melaye, representing Kogi West Senatorial Dsitrict in the National Assembly on the platform of the All Progressives Party (APC), on Wednesday, defected to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).

The Senator announced his defection from the APC to the PDP on the floor of the Senate on Wednesday.

Dino Melaye has been having rough battles with APC, including Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State. He has been vocal in the criticism of the APC government which exposed him to dangers of political attacks, using security operatives.
The embattled Senator recently had very rough encounter with the Nigeria Police after an unconfirmed allegation of illegal possession of firearms and arming thugs in Kogi State, among others. The recent drama surrounding his arrest in Abuja for investigation and prosecution in Kogi raised serious concerns about the adherence to the rule of law in law enforcement in Nigeria. Melaye has overtime become a victim of circumstance in the APC government he played crucial roles to bring to power in 2015.
