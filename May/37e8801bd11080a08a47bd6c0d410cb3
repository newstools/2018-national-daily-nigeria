The police in Lagos have arraigned Mrs Alexia Thomas before an Igbosere Magistrate’s Court for allegedly assaulting a chief magistrate.
The chief magistrate had summoned Thomas to the court, but she said she did not know the magistrate.
Thomas and a police prosecutor who wanted to arrest her for allegedly jumping bail had been having problem before now.
She was arraigned in Court 3 of the Magistrate’s Court sometime last year for a bailable offence.
But she refused to show up in the subsequent sittings.
A bench warrant was issued on the woman yet the police could not effect her arrest until May 17, 2018 when the prosecutor accidentally saw her at the court.
“In the process of arresting her, she started shouting which disturbed the ongoing proceedings in the courtrooms.
“The Chief Magistrate, Court 1, summoned the woman into his court, but she declined. She said she had no business with the magistrate, who directed that she should be arraigned,” a source revealed.
She was brought before Presiding Magistrate B.I. Bakare on three counts of assault and engaging in conduct likely to cause a breach of the peace.
According to police prosecutor Friday Mammeh, a sergeant, the offences, contravened sections 104(1) (a) and 168(d) of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015.
Thomas, however, pleaded not guilty to the charge and was admitted to bail in the sum of N250,000 with one gainfully employed surety in the like sum.
The case was adjourned till June 20.
