Snoop Dogg is the latest celebrity to weigh in on Kanye West’s controversial week … and he’s had some fun with Photoshop.
The “Gin and Juice” rapper posted an edited photo of West to Instagram, saying that Kim Kardashian’s husband is “all white now.” In the photo, West’s skin appears to be significantly lightened.
This isn’t the first time Snoop has trolled West. After Yeezy’s pro-Trump tirade last week, Snoop said that West seemed like he was in a real-life version of Get Out. (Being in the “sunken place” is a reference that both Kardashian and West have poked fun at before.)
Earlier this week, Snoop found himself in the news with West after his cousin Daz Dillinger called for a gang attack on Yeezy.
On Sunday, Dillinger posted a since-deleted video to Instagram calling for the Crips to pay West a visit. “Yo, national alert, all the Crips out there, y’all f*** Kanye up,” he declared.
Dillinger is a member of rap duo Tha Dogg Pound and took issue with West praising the president.
“We are in one boat, and they’re killing all of us. He jumps over there and says, ‘Master, I’m [on] your side. … I’m with you, Master Trump. Burn all these n******,’” Snoop’s cousin said. “Stay in Calabasas, you hear me? ’Cause we got a Crip alert for Kanye. … All the Crips out there, you see that n*****, bang on his ass, f*** his ass up. F*** Kanye West up.”
Police confirmed to Yahoo Entertainment that they were investigating the threat, as they would rather err on “the side of caution.”
As for West, he said on TMZ Live that he found the threat to be sweet. You know, the same interview where the rapper declared that slavery was a “choice”?
“I was like, ‘Aw, that’s so dope, they love me,’” West said of his reaction to seeing the Crip alert. “That’s like my brother, your brother beat you up. Like, ‘Man you getting out of line, bro, you trippin’, imma beat you up.’ I was like, aw, man, that’s love, man. Daz love me and I love Daz.”
It’s unclear if West finds Snoop’s Photoshopped image “dope” as well.
