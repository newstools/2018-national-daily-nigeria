The National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Chief John Odigie-Oyegun, the President of the Senate, Dr. Bukola Saraki, and Speaker of the House of Representatives, Right Honourable Yakubu Dogara, were absent as former Governor of Edo State, Adams Oshiomhole, declared for the national chairman of the party in Abuja on Thursday.
Comrade Adams Oshiomhole formally declared to contest the National Chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) at the Osun Hall, Transcorp Hilton Hotel, Abuja Thursday, in the National Convention scheduled for June 23.
Governor of Imo State and Chairman of the APC’s Progressives Governors’ Forum, Owelle Rochas Okorocha, supported the former governor’s candidacy, among other party chieftains.
President Muhammadu Buhari had a fortnight ago endorsed Oshiomhole for APC national chairman. The former governor is believed to be sponsored by Asiwaju Bola Tinubu.
Oshiomhole emphasized the need for party supremacy among party members and strict adherence to the manifesto of the party by elected APC members.
