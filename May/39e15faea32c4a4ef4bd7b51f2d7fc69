Mohammed Salah insists he cannot be compared with Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, as he is yet to consistently perform over a prolonged period of a number of years.
Salah has been in incredible form in the 2017-18 season, scoring 32 goals in just 36 Premier League appearances, thus setting a new record for the amount of goals scored in a 38-game campaign .
He has won a host of awards, too, collecting the Golden Boot , the Premier League Player of the Year prize , the FWA Footballer of the Year and the PFA Player of the Year awards.
Such form has led to comparisons with the Barcelona and Real Madrid superstars, one of which he will soon face in the Champions League final, when the Reds take on Los Blancos in Ukraine.
However, Salah is insistent that he has yet to reach the level of either La Liga icon.
“Not at all,” he told Egypt Today when asked if he was bothered by the comparisons.
“But I don’t want to say that I am happy with these kinds of comparisons, because each of them was at top level for 10 or 11 years. Their performance level is stable.
“Yet, I need to maintain my high performance level for many seasons. I hope I can do so. Definitely, they are great players.”
Messi has scored 45 goals in all competitions this season, while Ronaldo has netted 43. Salah, meanwhile, has 44 to his name.
