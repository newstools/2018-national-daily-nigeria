A team of Nigerian surgeons successfully separated four-month-old twins conjoined at the Federal Medical Center (FMC) Yola, Adamawa State.
Auwal Abubakar, Chief Medical Director of the hospital, explained in Yola that the operation which took four hours to perform was conducted on May 14, 2018.
“We had a successful operation of conjoined female twins (omphilopagus). The development was recorded following a team work from different medical units,” he said.
Abubakar added that the twins have an “excellent” chance of survival.
He advocated more efforts to reduce the rate of medical tourism in the country, saying that Nigerian doctors are capable of competing with their counterparts in developed countries if given the necessary support.
