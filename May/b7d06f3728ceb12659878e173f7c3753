Following its primaty election for the Ekiti governorship election that ended up in violence last Saturday, the APC has rescheduled its electiom for May 11.
The partyâ€™s publicity secretary Bolaji Abdullahi made this known while addressing journalists at the headquarters in Abuja on Tuesday.
Steel and Mine Minisiter Kayode Fayemi has threatened he will sue the party if the election was cancelled because he believed he was leading other candidates before the election was disrupted.
The election committee led by Nasarawa Gov. Tamko Al-Makura on Monday submitted the report of the primary, and the party promised to review the full report of the event.
Out of the 33 aspirants including two former governors and three former senators are contesting for the ticket of the APC, no fewer than 27 of them signed a petition to the National Chairman of the party, John Odigie-Oyegun, as well as leaders of the party,.
They were requesting for a new committee for a rescheduled primary.
The petition addressed to the NWC, was also copied to President Muhammadu Buhari, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo and a national leader of the party, Bola Tinubu.
According to the petitioners , some members of the NWC who were part of the organising committee of the primary, were glaringly biased and contributed to the violence that disrupted the primary.
