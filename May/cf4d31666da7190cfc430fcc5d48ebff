President Muhammadu Buhari in a special interview session with Voice of America, Hausa service, in Washington, United States on Tuesday morning, disclosed his approval for recruitment of 6,000 police officers to reinforce the Nigeria Police in dealing with the challenges of rising insecurity in the country.
President Buhari remarked that additional security measures were being put in place to check cases of insecurity in Nigeria.
“We will put in place more measures to check insecurity in the country including increasing the number of policemen and train them.
“I have approved the recruitment of 6,000 policemen by the police authorities and I directed that those recruited must come from all the 776 local government areas of the federation.
“Even if it means recruiting one person each from the 776 they should do that instead of going to motor parks, railway stations or market for the recruitment exercise.
“I gave (Police authorities) them this directive,’’ he said.
The president, who expressed reservation on the call for the establishment of state police as being advocated by state governors, said Nigerians must abide by constitutional provision in regard to the matter.
