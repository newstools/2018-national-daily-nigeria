The APC caucus in the House of Reps have endorsed Adams Oshiomhole in the run-up to the ruling party’s national chairman contest.
House Leader Femi Gbajabiamila announced this after the the Edo former governor and his campaign team met the lawmakers at the National Assembly complex Tuesday evening.
At the meeting was Speaker Yakubu Dogara, Deputy Speaker, Yusuf Lasun, Gbajabiamila and other APC lawmakers.
Oshiomhole also has behind him President Muhammadu Buhari, APC leader Bola Tinubu, and the party’s governors.
His main rival in the coming contest is the current chairman John Odigie Oyegun, another Edo former governor, who is likely to re-contest.
But former governor of Cross River State, Clement Ebri, has also declared intention to contest.
The party chairmanship crisis has been raging since Buhari declared as unconstitutional the elongation of tenure the party’s National Working Committee gave Oyegun early in the year.
