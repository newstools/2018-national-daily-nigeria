The Imo chapter of the All Progressive Congress (APC) says it has shifted Saturday’s local government congress to Monday, citing advice by the party’s national working committee (NWC).
Hilary Eke, Chairman of the party in the state, said on Saturday that the advice to postpone the congress followed an attack by hoodlums on the party’s state secretariat on Friday.
Eke also confirmed the indefinite suspension of two members of the party, Charles Amadi and Okenze Obinna.
He said the suspended members were allegedly involved in anti-party activities.
“Following our observations of their involvement in illegal activities, we have henceforth suspended the affected persons and the general public should take note,” he said.
Meanwhile, Rochas Okorocha, governor of Imo, has praised the APC NWC for postponing the local government congress.
Okorocha said the decision has saved what would have resulted in a bloodshed as thugs have continued to attack both party members and the office over the outcome of the last Saturday’s ward congress.
Speaking through Sam Onwuemeodo, his chief press secretary, Okorocha accused some “opposition members of the party” of plans to destroy the party.
Okorocha pledged that leaders of the APC will not allow them to succeed in their “evil game”.
