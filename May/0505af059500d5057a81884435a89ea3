Nigeria Women Premier League Referee Joy Sunday has been named the best referee in the NWPL for week 7, was recently rewarded N20,000 cash by NFF Vice President, Seyi Akinwunmi, National Daily learnt.
The award which is sponsored by the NFF Vice President, Seyi Akinwunmi, is aimed at promoting and rewarding excellence in the Nigerian Women Football League.
The FCT Referee Association Member officiated the NWPL Week 7  game between Sunshine Queens FC and Osun Babes FC played at the Akure Township Stadium, the game ended 1-0 in favour of the Owena Mermaids.
The Ebonyi-born referee beat off competition from Peace Ikerebe of the Edo State Referee Association and Fatimo Rabiu of the Ogun State Referee Association to win the cash prize of N20,000.
Secret assessors who assessed the game across all centres of the week 7 fixtures, nominated Sunday Joy, Peace Ikerebe and Fatima Robiu, but the 29 year old from FCT got more votes at the end of the day after anaylsis showed that her positioning, fitness and work rate was near perfect.
An ecstatic Sunday said she is  really surprised, as i am short of words. Its not just about the money, but its more about someone remembering to reward referees. We referees are not always remembered, honoured or rewarded for our hard work. I want to say a special thank you to Seyi Akinwunmi for this.
