The Deputy Governor of Bauchi State, Alhaji Nuhu Gadado, on Wednesday, resigned from office; he submitted his resignation letter to the Governor.
The resignation of Deputy Governor Nuhu Gadado in Bauchi State is widely conceived to reflect the deepening crisis in the All Progressives Congress (APC) across the country.  The deputy governor was elected on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in 2015.
National Daily gathered that the Special Assistant on Communication Matters to the Deputy Governor, Yakubu Adamu, admitted that Gadado’s letter was sent to the Governor, through the Office of the Secretary to the State Government, on Wednesday.
Another aide, Sufiyanu Gidado had also confirmed the development.
The deputy governor stated in the letter that he had earlier reiterated his commitment to serve for one term and has no intention for re-election.
“Ordinarily, I should have remained up to the end of the tenure, but, with the current dampened spirit and waning zeal as it relates to my official engagements, my continued stay will not be fair and truthful to you as my brother and leader.
“In this regard, I feel sure that, Your Excellency will readily recollect the most recent one – on – one discussion we had, precisely, on Thursday, April 19th, 2018, in your office, where, among other issues, I expressed to you, my contemplation to ‘step aside’, if need be, in order to free my conscience.
“I regret to say that it has become necessary to yield to that inner calling, and may this development be in accordance with the blessed will and guidance of Allah (SWT), Ameen,” the Deputy Governor declared in his letter.
The Deputy Governor of Bauchi State, Alhaji Nuhu Gadado, has depended democracy in Nigeria with his resignation; politicians in Nigerian seldom give up the perquisite of office and resign from same office.
