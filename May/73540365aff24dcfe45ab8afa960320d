The Asset Management Company of Nigeria (AMCON) recently obtained an interim forfeiture order from a Federal High Court sitting in Lagos with respect to the assets of Sea Petroleum Oil and Gas Limited belonging to Senator Stella Odua.

The court also granted AMCON the permission to appoint a receiver manager for the company.

Among the assets covered by the forfeiture order are over 9000 square kilometres of land along Lekki-Epe Express Way; two Tank farms, a property at Maiyegun Tourism Zone, Lekki Peninsula Scheme 11, Lagos Island and a filling station complex at kilometre 14, Lekki Epe Expressway, Ikota, Lagos State.
