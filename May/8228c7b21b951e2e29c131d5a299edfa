The APC state congresses across the nation on Saturday were no better than those held at the ward level weeks ago.
There were incidents of violence in no fewer than 10 states where parallel executives emerged.
Lagos, Ondo, Kwara, Abia, Ebonyi, Delta, Kogi, Zamfara, Enugu, Oyo, and Imo were amongst states that produced two bodies of esectitives.
In Bauchi, a faction loyal to Speaker Yakubu Dogara biycotted the congress.
Factions loyal to President Muhammadu Buhari and Sen. President Bukola Saraki in Kogi and Kwara respectively elected separate executives.
Political observers wonder how these parallel executives will participate in the national congress coming up in Abuja in June.
Violence has been the major feature in the APC since January, when tenure elongation crisis flared up, pitting Buhari and party stalwart Bola Tinubu against chairman John Oyegun.
