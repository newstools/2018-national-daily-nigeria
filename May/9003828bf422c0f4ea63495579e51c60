Kogi West Senator Dino has been remanded in police custody for the next 38 days.
After that will come the commencement of hearing in the suit the police brought against him and three others.
Melaye was arraigned before a magistrate court Thursday morning in Lokoja on charges of gunrunning, kidnapping, amd others.
His lawyer Mike Ozokome argued for bail, but the police counsel, Alex Isihon said the offence is not bailable.
Ruling on the suit after a short recess, Chief Magistrate Suleiman Abdulahi denied the bail application and asked him to be kept in prison custody till June 11, 2018.
Two suspects of a violent gang in February alleged the senator armed and finance them to cause mayhem in Kogi.
He has, however, denied it, saying the Gov. Yahaya Bello and the police have conspired against him.
