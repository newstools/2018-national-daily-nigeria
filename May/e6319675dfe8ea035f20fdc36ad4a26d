After losing his assistant coach Rui Faria, who looks set to take a move into management himself, Jose Mourinho revealed that he is not looking for a replacement.
The Manchester United coach instead will look to restructure his coaching staff.
“Moving forward I will organise my coaching staff in a way where the assistant manager figure doesn’t exist,” he revealed after beating Watford on the final day of the season.
“I’m going to have coaches, assistant coaches, fitness coaches and a structure where they have specialists in different areas connected to performance, and my analysts.
“I’m not going to have an assistant manager in the sense of the word.
“I think it will be Michael Carrick in future, when he has his badges, when he has his pro licence, when he makes the bridge from player to assistant.
“I have nobody in the world of football ready to be my assistant manager so I prefer to educate people.”
