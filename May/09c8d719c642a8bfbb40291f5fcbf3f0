This is not the best of time for the Imo state governor, Rochas Okorocha. 

Still battling with the disgrace of being sidelined from his state’s All Progressives Congress (APC) congress few weeks back, his private radio station in the state, Reach FM, has been sealed.

According to the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC), the radio station which was newly established allegedly by the governor, was operating without licence

In handing down the closure order, Alhaji Bugudu Almalik, director, Media Operation Unit of NBC, said in Owerri, the capital of Imo state, that neither the name of Rochas Okorocha nor any member of his family was issued with radio operating license.

NBC observed that having failed to secure a radio license, the owner connived with some NBC workers to locate owners of approved licenses that were not in operation.

However, Almalik made it clear that it as an action that is not allowed by NBC laws for anybody to use another body’s licence because Radio Broadcast Licence by law, is not transferable.

Accordingly, NBC expressed worry on why individual could resume operation of a radio station when neither his name nor his agent reflected in the board of trustees of the firm that applied for Reach FM.
 
NBC revealed further that following their lack of regard for due process, the owners in connivance with one Mr. Kennedy Zanders commenced broadcasting in the station without NBC visitation, confirmation nor approval
 
The federal agency also noted that further investigation into the matter is ongoing.
