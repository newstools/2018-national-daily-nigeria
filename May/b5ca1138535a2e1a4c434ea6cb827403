Arsenal
What do they need?
There is a quiet revolution to organise. If Mikel Arteta or Unai Emery does indeed get the job, the first task will be to oversee an overhaul of the first-team squad that aims to provide a stable platform for a pretty brilliant front five. At least one – and probably two – central defenders are needed, along with competition/support for Granit Xhaka in central midfield. That list will be added to if one or both of Jack Wilshere and Aaron Ramsey leave, and there’s also the question over the goalkeeping position. At least there isn’t a World Cup in the way and an early end to the transfer window. Gulp.
What will they get?
The arrival of Sven Mislintat as head of recruitment and Raul Sanllehi as head of football relations offers hope that Arsenal might actually be taking steps in the right direction. Rather than the customary leak of transfer ‘warchests’ around season ticket renewal time, Arsenal instead made it clear that the new manager will only have £50m to spend. Expect at least one central defender to join alongside Jonny Evans, and a central midfielder too. Also expect Petr Cech to still be No. 1 next season, while Wojciech Szczesny takes over from Gianluigi Buffon. Silly.
What’s been said
‘Arsène Wenger’s successor as Arsenal manager will have to work with a restricted summer budget of around £50 million following two club-record transfers and three major new contracts in the last 12 months. Unlike new managers over recent seasons at the two Manchester clubs, Arsenal’s new appointment will not be able to transform the squad with a large spending spree without first making big-money sales himself’ – Jeremy Wilson, Daily Telegraph, April 23.
Bournemouth
What do they need?
To be busy without going mad, if you listen to Eddie Howe. The Bournemouth manager was at pains to point out that he wants quality rather than quantity, but Howe also knows that Bournemouth’s Premier League consolidation allows the club to think about looking up the table. This could be the summer that a smattering of players who were with the club in League One might move on. Think Marc Pugh, Harry Arter and even Simon Francis; all would need to be replaced. Steve Cook, Charlie Daniels and Ryan Fraser are more safe.
What will they get?
A central midfielder seems a certainty even given the rise of Lewis Cook. Should Dan Gosling be starting 20 Premier League games for a team with top-half ambitions? Pugh and Arter will go, meaning a new left winger would be handy, but Howe’s biggest task might be keeping hold of Josh King and Junior Stanislas. Also, don’t be too surprised if Jermain Defoe is moved on. Howe loves buying a new centre forward.
What’s been said?
“It’s going to be a big transfer window for us this summer, we’re going to have to be very smart with what we do. We’re looking forward to the challenges that poses for us. It won’t be a large turnover, I don’t think that’s healthy for the team. But certainly we’re going to need to do certain things, we’ll need to be active in the market. I only want quality additions, it’s not about numbers for me. It’s about trying to improve the team and the squad. It’s about the quality of the player not the amount of players you bring in” – Eddie Howe, May 11.
Brighton
What do they need?
At the risk of being chased out of Brighton, a backup – and eventual replacement – for Glenn Murray is needed, as he cannot be relied upon to repeat his 2017/18 season. Another central midfielder would not go amiss, and Chris Hughton would also like another wide player. Right-back Bruno is getting on despite his new contract, while Uwe Heunemeier’s return to Germany makes a back-up central defender a priority.
What will they get?
Head of recruitment and analysis Paul Winstanley has been one of the unheralded stars of Brighton’s rise. Expect him to work with Hughton on signing players from central Europe for comparatively modest fees. Having consolidated themselves in the Premier League and established themselves as a well-run club, Brighton could also benefit from the odd loan from top-six clubs while raiding the Football League for its best. I had a dream that they signed Rudy Gestede, which both says a lot about me but also is entirely feasible.
What’s been said?
“I would see possibly less business done in the summer [than in January]. We have a core that’s here that has been successful in staying in this division. What we need to do is to add to that squad, what ever quality we can add. Remember, even Jurgen Locadia, who we brought in for big money and feeling his way, has been really good in training but I’ve gone with the tried and trusted. He’ll hopefully be like a new signing for us come the summer” – Chris Hughton, May 7.
Burnley
What do they need?
Last summer, Sean Dyche found replacements for his best goalkeeper and defender within his squad, and both performed so well that they became upgrades. This year he surely cannot hope to repeat that trick, but could be asked to. James Tarkowski will be subject to interest, Tom Heaton will surely go and Steven Defour may also attract offers. Are Chelsea coming back in for Ashley Barnes? – (No) – That aside, Dyche will supplement his squad ahead of a European campaign, but there are no standout gaps. A right winger would be lovely.
What will they get?
Burnley’s first-team signings have predominantly been sourced from below rather than above them in the league ladder, a strategy used by Dyche to maintain hunger within the squad and avoid coasting. They may pinch a couple from the relegated trio, but expect most young, highly-rated Championship players to be linked. Having European football is persuasive. Josh Vela, Ryan Woods, Tom Lawrence and Bobby Reid; come on down.
What’s been said?
“It’s hard for us to buy ‘the one’ who can walk straight into our team. We have to look at a high level of development player – not necessarily someone for £100,000 to turn into a world beater – but the kind of market for us is a few million quid. We can’t jump to £25m for people, five times over, we’ve got to look not just for the next six months but the six months after that, 18 months, 24 months, and that is tough. But you have to keep looking and future proofing, getting the players in we think we can mould for the future” – Sean Dyche, April 21.
