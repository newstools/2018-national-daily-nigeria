The Chairperson of the Nigeria Women Football League, Aisha Falode, has appealed to clubs in the Nigeria Women Premier League to desist from making hasty comments about officiating of matches both on home and away games.
Aisha told National Daily that Last week, there were about five different complaints on conduct of matches at different venues, but none of these got to the secretariat of the NWFL but went viral on the social media.
“This is not good for the progress of the league and the security of players, officials and referees alike,” she said.
Falode stated that the board of the NWFL has regularly appealed to the NFF’s Referee’s Appointment Committee and the Nigeria Referee’s Association, to appoint the best referees in the land for NWPL games.
The NWFL boss was full of plaundits for Lagos State Referee, Ruth Okafor, who went out of her duty as a centre referee to save the life of a player who collapsed on the pitch during a game.
She praised Okafor for her heroics and also commended the  Lagos FA chairman and NFF vice president, Seyi Akinwunmi, for rewarding the referee.
“The NWFL will make appropriate recommendation to the Nigeria Referees Association, for Ruth Okafor to be rewarded.”
