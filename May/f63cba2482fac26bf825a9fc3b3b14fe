Former president Olusegun Obasanjo has identified four ways to prevent threat to the security of a country.
Obasanjo revealed this at a three-day retreat organised by ASIS International Nigeria Chapter held at the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library (OOPL) in Abeokuta, the Ogun state capital.
The theme of the retreat is: “Building Capacity For Professional Growth.”
The former president identified good leadership, governance, development and values as the for cardinal points that must be in place to prevent threat to security.
Obasanjo stated that a good leader must have experience, both good and bad sides of life, that would help him to strategise on how to handle any threat.
According to him: “Prison life gave me a wider experience about life and that helped me when i became the president. Prison experience has enriched my life.”
“When a government is good, it does not have to stress itself to have the people’s love and that helped me to win second term in office as president.
”Osita Chidioka’s book is a good development. Back in the days when i was growing up, if people don’t know the source of a man’s wealth, nobody will allow their daughter to marry him but such is not happening anymore. We have lost that value.
”In submission, if these four areas highlighted are right, the threat to security would be minimised.”
