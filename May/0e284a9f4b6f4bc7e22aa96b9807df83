No one is more relentless than the Reds at the moment, that the conclusion of a Liverpool fan who made a post online recently. In his words, ‘I’ve been trying to distract myself from getting too excited by the final this weekend, but highlights from the first-leg against Roma was on last night, and I couldn’t help myself’.
He went further to narrate some more:
“What I noticed, upon second viewing, is the ferocity of our attack soon after Salah’s sublime first. Robertson punts a long-ball up field, which the Roma right-back heads out for a throw in 50 yards from goal – but the crowd is pumped, there’s an electric feeling in the stadium and a mighty roar goes up around Anfield. Sitting on my couch, I can’t help but jump up, clench my fists and yell Come ON!
“As I slumped back down it got me thinking. Does any other team in world football have that relentless pursuit of scoring one more goal, than Liverpool? It was as if we were 2 goals down against a relegation threatened side, just scored our first, momentum on our side, last ten minutes, throwing the kitchen sink. But we weren’t. We were in the Champion’s league semi-final, with away goals and against an Italian defence.
“As a Liverpool supporter, watching United games that ran into Fergie time was excruciating and thrilling at the same time. I could be wrong but chasing a game, with their fullbacks bombing down the wings, pacey wingers causing havoc and a clinical striker who you could bet your house on, was the highlight of being a United supporter. So as I read good-natured mailbox debates about Liverpool being lucky to get to this stage, and the talk of trophies versus league positions, I’m just thankful of the entertaining football we play. And those adrenaline filled moments that get me out of my seat, fist pumped, goosebumps everywhere, watching a re-runs of a football game”.
