Former Nigerian international and Everton of England, Daniel Amokachi has said the late Super Eagles coach, Stephen Keshi of being a football agent during his time in charge of the national team.
Amokachi who spoke with National Daily made this remark while advising coach Gernot Rohr not to ignore out of favour striker, Brown Ideye from the list of selected players to the world cup.
Daniel explained that ” Brown for me,was one player that I regret that we did not take to the world cup in 2014.
” We ended up going to the world cup with players I didn’t even know during our contract. I think it is very tough if a coach is already an agent,” Amokachi continued.
” It is very, very difficult, and that is why I always say you cannot be a coach and  an  agent at the same time,” the former Everton star added.
