Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, has confirmed that Yaya Toure will leave the club at the end of this season.
Toure, who signed a one-year contract at the end of last season, joined City from Barcelona in 2010.
During his Friday press conference ahead of Sunday’s Premier League against Huddersfield, Guardiola confirmed that the Ivory Coast international will be leaving the Etihad Stadium.
“The Brighton game, we will focus on winning and Yaya. We are going to try to win the game for him.
“Yaya came here at the start of the journey. Where we are now is because of what he has done. He was a key player,” he said.
Guardiola, meanwhile, said he is still in no rush to wrap up his contract talks.
“I stay for sure one more year. We have three more games. We have time for everything in life.
“What we have to think about is winning another game. We can break huge records but the target is to win the game,” he added.
