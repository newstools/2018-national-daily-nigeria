A brilliant strike by Tasiu Lawal was all Katsina United needed to win all the three points in one of the NPFL match day 22 decided at the Muhammadu Dikko Stadium in Katsina recently, National Daily learnt.
‘The Changi Boys’ are still fifth on the league table with 33 points from 22 games, while Sunshine Stars have dropped to 19th on the table.
Coach Abdullahi Biffo told National Daily that his boys did brilliantly to grind out the crucial maximum points.
“Yes, a fantastic and tough game. But I commend my players putting up a good fight to grind out all the important three points,” he said.
“My boys played to instructions and we created so many scoring chances, but the final touch was lacking, which was our greatest on undoing.”
