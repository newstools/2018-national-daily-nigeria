There was pandemonium along Ada George Road in Port Harcourt Thursday morning when rampaging  soldiers sacked the Rumukpakani Police Station.

A soldier was  allegedly killed by a policeman earlier.

The murdered soldier,  who was in mufti, was said to have been shot near the Police station by one of the policemen on duty.

A group of angry soldiers had to storm the Police station, arrest the Divisional Police Officer, and the murder suspect.
