The League Bloggers Awards (LBA) have named Olufemi Kayode and Solomon
Ogbeide as the player and manager respectively for the month of April
in the Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL),National Daily learnt.
The Lobi Stars duo emerged winners after posting impressive
performances with the league leaders in the month of April.
Lobi goalkeeper Kayode beat the trio of Junior Lokosa of Kano Pillars,
Emeka Ogbugh of Rivers United and Kwara United’s Stephen Alfred to the
player’s prize.
Kayode’s performance in April was instrumental to Lobi posting a
superb outing as he weighed in with two clean sheets in four matches
as his club finished the month undefeated. The Lobi stopper also
distinguished himself in the games at Abia Warriors and Sunshine Stars
where the NPFL leaders secured a point each. He also stopped a Sikiru
Alimi penalty at Sunshine Stars to help his side avoid defeat in Akure
on Matchday 19.
National Daily gathered Ogbeide masterminded Lobi’s undefeated run in April from the sidelines and he brushed aside the challenge for the manager’s award from
Stanley Eguma of Rivers United, Hamza Abara of Niger Tornadoes and
Gbenga Ogunbote of Enugu Rangers to win.
Kayode and Ogbeide will be presented with their awards in one of their
upcoming NPFL games by the LBA.
