The military have intensified operations in Benue State, which was extended to other parts of troubled states in the North East under the siege of Fulani herdsmen invasion and killings. Accordingly, the Defence Headquarters in Abuja on Friday announced the commencement of “Operation Whirl Stroke” for Benue, Nasarawa, Taraba and Zamfara states, to counter the influx of armed herdsmen and militia groups operating within the region.
The Acting Director of Defence Information, Brigadier General John Agim, speaking at the Tactical Air Command Headquarters in Makurdi, revealed that the operation which began on May 8, consists of all the military services, police and Department of State Services (DSS).
Agim also confirmed the arrest of militia groups, armed herdsmen and associates of a notorious suspected criminal Terwase Akwaza, who has since been declared wanted.
Also, the Force Commander in charge of the new operation, Major General Mutiu Yekini, assured residents of improved security with the operations covering both land and air targets.
These states where the military operations are taking place have lost thousands of lives, property worth millions of naira, lost farmlands and farm produce, have their wives and daughters raped, by the invading Fulani herdsmen who operate with sophisticated weapons with minimal security intervention over the years.
