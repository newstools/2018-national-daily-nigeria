A group which goes by the name of Bille Youth Vanguard in Rivers state has accused the Nigerian Army of being involved in oil theft instead of protecting the nation’s commonwealth from oil thieves.

In a statement released by the group and made available to National Daily, it said Bille community has become centre for oil bunkering at night with the military playing active role in the theft.

“Our community is normal in the daytime but at night it will turn into a marketplace for crude oil, whereby oil is lifted openly like they are buying and selling in Aba market.

“Please, President, send people to Billie without notice at night, you will see trading activity is like that of Ojuelegba that the great Fela sang about.

“You will be shocked that armed men who are supposed to protect the pipeline have changed their job to protector of thieves. They are guiding the vessels of people destroying pipelines and loading crude oil.

“Sometimes, in broad daylight, big vessels come in and out of Bille freely surrounded by escorts. We have heard that security officials are making millions from protecting these criminals and participating in illegal bunkering.

“Mr. President, we beg for your strong and urgent intervention. We call on the chief of defence staff, chief of army staff, other security agencies and the general public to help us reduce this evil.

The group said the security officers can no longer protect the community, which they say is being destroyed by oil spillage, and urged the federal government to send them a fresh army.
