It is a known fact that recently divorced female singer, Tiwa Savage and Wizkid have been rumoured to be lovers in recent times, and this is as a result of the public display of affection exhibited by them.

Tiwa a.k.a Mama Jamil and Wizkid, a.k.a, Baba Boluwatife are currently a hot topic on Nigerian social media and below are some reactions or speculations (if you like) on both of them.

“Seems Wizkid and Tiwa Savage are really Dating…”
“You see Wizkid traveling with Tekno or someone else, no problem, but Wizkid and Tiwa Savage? They’re dating”
“Nigerians are not educated, they just graduate from school. Daz all”
 “I don’t care if Wizkid and Tiwa are shagging. As long as its lowkey between them, its not my problem. Do you know the funniest thing, Even if they decide to make it public and decide to have kids together, its still not my problem”.
