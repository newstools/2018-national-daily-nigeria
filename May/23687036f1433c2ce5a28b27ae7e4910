Security was been beefed up around the Alex Ekwueme Square, Awka, Anambra State, venue of the Ohaneze Ndigbo summit on restructuring which commenced on Monday.
It was gathered that heavily armed personnel of the Army, Navy, Police and NSCDC were strategically positioned on the adjoining roads to the venue.
Officials of the FRSC were also around Aromma Junction and the Alex Ekwueme Square, to ensure free flow of traffic.
Police anti-bomb units were also stationed in and around the venue, among other proactive measures taken.
The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) had threatened to cause violence at the event, warning guests to stay away in their own interest.
It was indicated that Traffic was redirected from the area as workers at the Federal and State High Courts, State House of Assembly and Universal Basic Education Board were searched before passing the venue to their offices.
Haruna Mohammed, Police Public Relations Officer in Anambra, had warned IPOB members to steer clear the venue or have themselves to blame.
Mohammed said adequate security would be provided for all law abiding citizens.
“I am sounding this as a note of warning to any group that plans to make trouble during the summit. We are ready for them and will not tolerate any violence.
“Our men are ready for them and we are urging members of the public to go about their duties diligently,” he said.
