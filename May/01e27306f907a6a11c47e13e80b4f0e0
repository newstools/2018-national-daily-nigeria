President Muhammadu Buhari, on Friday, arrived Nigeria from the United Kingdom where he went for a medical checkup early this week. The President returned to Abuja after a three-day medical trip to London, United Kingdom.
The President at the Airport stated: ““It is not earlier than expected. I just went for a further medical check-up and I am alright, thank you.”
His aircraft landed at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja, at 7.00 pm this Friday.
The Special Assistant on Media and Publicity to the President, Garba Shehu, in excitement, said the President was expected to return on Saturday but he came back to the country a day earlier. The SSA noted that those who were skeptical about the President’s trip to the UK immediately after returning from a working visit to the UK, were playing politics.
He reiterated that the President had a technical stopover in UK on his way back from the US for aircraft maintenance in London after meeting President Donald Trump in Washington D.C.
Shehu narrated that President Buhari then had a meeting with his doctor who requested he returns for a meeting which he agreed to do.
Shehu also revealed that upon his return, President Buhari will embark on a two-day State visit to Jigawa on Monday and Tuesday next week.
President Buhari departed Nigeria on Tuesday, May 8 for the medical trip to London.
