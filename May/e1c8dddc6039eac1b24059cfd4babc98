A middle- aged man has been sentenced to life imprisonment by an Ondo State High Court sitting in Akure the state over his involvement in the abduction of one Alhaji Adeyinka Yusuf.

The convict and one Abimbola Osinyemi were arrested by the men of the state police command, Ore Division, over the kidnap of the victim.
They were later arraigned on a three-count which included conspiracy to commit a felony, aiding and abetting kidnapping.
They had pleaded ‘not guilty’ to the counts preferred against them when it was read to them.
The victim, who testified during one of the proceedings, narrated that he was kidnapped on the fateful day when he was on his way home from work by the convict and some other armed persons, who were said to be at large.
He testified that his neighbours had rescued him by barricading the road, preventing the hoodlums from taking him away. He said the matter was later reported at the Ore police station.
The court admitted some exhibits which included two cartridges, Honda Accord car and the statements of the accused persons and that of the complainant.
In his judgment, the judge, Justice O. A Odusola, with the graphic narration of the complainant, it has been proved beyond reasonable doubt that the first defendant had aided, facilitated and encouraged the kidnap by making his car available for the dastardly act.
He was sentenced to life imprisonment. He, however, ruled that there was not enough evidence to convict the second accused person and discharged and acquitted him.
