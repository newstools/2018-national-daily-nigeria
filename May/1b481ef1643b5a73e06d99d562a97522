At a brief but gorgeous event inside the Transcorp Hilton Hotel, Abuja, Nigeria’s number three man and leading football enthusiast and financier also described the Mikel John Obi –led group as compelling role models, doing their job quietly on the pitch and accepting the rewards as and when such come without holding the nation to ransom.
“I have been following the performances and general behaviour of this squad. I must confess that I am very impressed. We no longer have schisms and different camps in the same camp, and you sacrifice a lot for the country without demanding so much before you go to battle.
“From the captain, Mikel Obi to the newest member of the squad, I assure you of the love of the entire country and the well –wishes of every Nigerian as you go to the FIFA World Cup and in fact, in all your endeavours.” He also praised Technical Adviser Gernot Rohr for the way he has adroitly managed the team and instilled discipline and sense of dedication.
President of the Nigeria Football Federation, Mr. Amaju Melvin Pinnick lauded Saraki for his proven love for, and support and encouragement of the three –time African champions during the FIFA World Cup qualifying race and even before.
Pinnick then announced to the team Dr. Saraki’s gift of $50,000 to the team ahead of Saturday’s friendly with England’s Three Lions at Wembley Stadium in London, and yet-to-be-revealed ‘special package’ for the entire team “for every unreplied goal” scored at the FIFA World Cup in Russia.
