Novak Djokovic moved into his first quarterfinal of 2018 on Thursday when he defeated Spain’s Albert Ramos-Vinolas 6-1, 7-5 at the Italian Open,National Daily learnt.
The four-time Rome champion is making his way back this year after a six-month injury absence before the Australian Open, which was followed by elbow surgery. And the 30-year-old showed some of his old form as he got past Ramos-Vinolas to set up a rematch with Japan’s Kei Nishikori for a semifinal berth.
The 11th-seeded Serb, who has reached eight of the last ten finals at the Italian Open, beat Nishikori in the first round in Madrid last week before falling in the second to Britain’s Kyle Edmund.
“I’m happy. I haven’t had too many matches of this quality of my tennis in the last 12 months,” said the 12-time Grand Slam champion whose last quarterfinal run came at Wimbledon last year.
