Otike Odibi, a lawyer living at Diamond Estate, Sangotedo, Ajah, Lagos, was already a dead man by the time those he informed a night before came to believe his wife Udeme meant to make good her threat: to stab Odibi to death.
Udeme, also a lawyer, went further by chopping off her husband’s genitals after cutting up his intestines.
She, however, didn’t stop there. The mother of one child from her first marriage attempted to take her own life, too, by stabbing herself.
Otibe and Udeme had a disagreement on Wednesday, neighbours said, and that degenerated to a threat.
The 50-year-old husband however informed his family and friends about his wife’s threat to kill him with a knife.
Lagos State PPRO said the couple have had three years of a stormy marriage before the last fatal disagreement.
Chike Oti also said the marriage was childless, though each partner has a child each fom their previous marriages.
According to him, a distress call was put across to the Divisional Police Officer, Ogombo division, around 7.30am–after the murder.
“Based on the information, the DPO mobilised a team of detectives to the scene where they found the man lying on the bed in a pool of blood with his stomach ripped open, exposing his intestines,’ he said.
“As if that was not enough, the killer severed his genitals and placed them on his right hand.
“However, before the arrival of the police, Mrs. Udeme, who had unsuccessfully attempted to commit suicide after allegedly killing her husband, was rushed to a hospital for treatment by neighbours.”
The state Commissioner of Police Edgal Imohimi has directed detectives from the homicide section of the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department, Yaba, as well as forensic experts to the scene of the crime for investigation.
