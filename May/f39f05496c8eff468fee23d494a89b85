The Kano Police State Command has refuted that the Police are not after Aminu Nurudeen, a Liberty Television reporter, who published a video of Ibrahim Idris, Inspector-General of Police (IGP), struggling to read a speech at an event.
There were reports that Nurudeen has gone into hiding after the Kano Police invited him for questioning over the video which embarrassed the IGP.
Musa Majiya, spokesman of the Kano State Police Command, in a statement, stated that no journalist was invited over the video clip.
Majiya said the Command maintained cordial relationship with the state’s chapter of the Nigerian Union of Journalists (NUJ).
“The attention of Kano State Police Command is drawn to trending headlines in some national dailies and online media that the ’Police Launched prove, threaten bloggers arrest’ over IGP’s trending video,” the statement read.
“The command hereby debunks the news as false in its entirety and an act by mischief makers.
“No journalist was arrested nor invited by the command for interrogation over the video clip. It is crystal clear that the ommand maintain cordial relationship with the state chapter of the NUJ, the correspondence Chapel and all bloggers.
“The media outlets responsible for the report had their correspondents here in Kano but none consulted the Command to verify the news. No manhunt of any journalist what so ever by the Kano Police Command,” Majiya declared.
