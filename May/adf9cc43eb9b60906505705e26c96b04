Former Gov. Segun Oni has threatened to dump the APC whose guber election ticket he just lost in the last Friday primary election in Ekiti.
While he has forwarded no complaint to the pary’s appeal panel, the APC regionl vice chairman is whining about how Kayode Fayemi’s supporters are treating his own supporters.
Fayemi, Nigeria’s solid minerals minister, won the party’s ticket for the July governorship election that 31 candidates aspired for.
According to Oni who polled over 481, a distant second, his supporters were receiving threats from Fayemi’s camp.
And he can’t take that because he has a responsibility to protect my supporters.
“But this habit of winners take all and what we are hearing that Segun Oni’s boys will be in the cooler for four years if APC wins is what I won’t tolerate,” he told journalists at Ifaki-Ekiti on Tuesday.
“We are not scavengers,’ he said.
He said he has and his supporters are being courted by other parties willing to offer him their tickets.
“But we said no, because we want this to be an example and become a new thinking that when you lose the primary, you must stay in your party even when you are popular.
“But if they continue to harass my supporters, I may quit the party, because I have the responsibility not only to protect them but to ensure that they are not taken for a ride,” Oni added.
