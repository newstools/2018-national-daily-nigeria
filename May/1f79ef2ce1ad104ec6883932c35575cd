The Ekiti State Governor, Ayodele Fayose, has mocked President Muhammadu Buhari and former President Olusegun Obasanjo over their latest disagreement over the $16bn allegedly spent on power during the tenure of the former President.
Fayose on his twitter handle said that he was enjoying the public display of “brickbats” between the two leaders.
The governor said that he had been vindicated on his earlier warning that those who brought Buhari would regret it.
He said, “I am enjoying these latest brickbats between President Buhari & Ex-President Obasanjo. They should keep exposing themselves for Nigerians to know what they have been hiding.
“Nigerians should remember I warned that those who brought Buhari will regret entrusting him with power.”
Obasanjo recently criticised Buhari and asked him not to seek a reelection in 2019.
Buhari said that Obasanjo had questions to answer regarding the $16bn he spent on power project.
However, Obasanjo in his reply said that the president was ignorant urging him to read his book “My Watch” to understand the matter.
