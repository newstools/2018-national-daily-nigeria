First, it might just be appropriate and in-place to reintroduce Sauce Kid to followers of Nigerian music. Back in the early 2000s, Sauce Kid was famous for songs such as Yebariba, E don dey mad, Under G, with the first seriously catapulting him at the time.  Sauce Kid, also known as Sinzu, was so in the game that an emerging Davido then would consider having a collabo with him.
Still on the trending radar, after the Chioma stunts and his Headies Awards testimonies, Davido puts in another item on the roll.
He is signing Sauce kid as an artist under his record label.
Yes, he has shocked his fans with the announcement of the agreement to sign American-based rapper to his DMW music label.
The announcement was made via social media as Davido announced that he had just signed Sauce Kid who is also known as Sinzu.
Sauce Kid was just released from jail a few months ago after being convicted for stealing $15,388 and he had to serve a two-year sentence before being released earlier this year.
Davido and Sauce Kid had worked before on the latter’s Carolina track and now Davido is helping Sauce Kid get back a floundering music career that never really moved on to the next level.
