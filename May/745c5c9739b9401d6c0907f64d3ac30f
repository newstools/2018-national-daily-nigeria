Chelsea and Manchester contest in the FA Cup final on Saturday at Wembley.
Both teams will be eager to get their hands on the oldest domestic competition trophy as it is the only chance of silverware for both clubs, having fallen short in the Premier League, Champions League and League Cup.
The FA Cup may not be as lucrative for top tier clubs as the Premier League or Champions League, however it is regarded as the best cup competition in the world given its heritage.
It still represents good value for clubs from the lower division though.
According to totalsportek, last year when Manchester United visited Cambridge United for the 3rd Round tie the game was shown live on TV, and Cambridge made £144,000.
The FA announced that next season’s Emirates FA Cup will see winning clubs pick up more than double from the competition prize fund.
Furthermore, the prize fund will benefit all participating clubs at every stage of the competition during the 2018-19 season.
