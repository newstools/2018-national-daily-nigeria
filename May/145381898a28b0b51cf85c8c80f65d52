President Muhammadu Buhari in an interview with the VOA, Hausa Service, in Washington, US, went really upset with Nigerian past leaders, going as far as invoking divine judgement on them all.
He insisted that the PDP under former Presidents Olusegun Obasanjo, Umar Yar’Adua, and Goodluck Jonathan, after 16 years in power, left debts for the country despite making huge income from oil.
According to him, there are no good roads or power supply to justify billions of dollars spent.
“Only God will judge this thing,”Buhari said on Tuesday.
He said he has had to come out and state that from 1999 to 2014, Nigeria was producing 2.2 million barrels of crude oil daily at a price of at least $100 per barrel.
“But when we came on board, the price fell to between $37 and $38 and hanged around $40 and $50.
“I went to the CBN – the governor of CBN is here. I asked him how far and he said nothing was left apart from debts.
“I said but this is what the country made? And he said yes, he knew, and I asked him where is the money? All is gone,” he said.
The president has always complained of past mismanagement by the PDP, but his critics will not take such excuses since he  and his party APC knew all that before he bid for power.
