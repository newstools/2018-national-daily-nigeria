The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has commended President Donald Trump of the United States of America over his decision to move US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, asking Nigeria and other countries to do the same.

President of CAN, Samson Ayokunle disclosed this on Tuesday via a statement issued by his spokesman, Adebayo Oladeji.

He also said the declaration made by President Donald Trump on December 6, 2017 is a fulfillment of Biblical prophecy.
Ayokunle, while commending the Israeli government on the 70th anniversary of its country, said the relocation of the capital to Jerusalem was “special anniversary present from the God of the patriarchs”.

“It is our prayers that other countries including Nigeria will relocate their embassies from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem,” he said.

“We appreciate the leadership role of the United States in the landmark historic event. We are happy that countries such as the United States of America, Guatemala, Honduras, Romania and Paraguay have relocated their embassies from Tel Aviv.”
 
Trump recently recognised Jerusalem as the capital of Israel; a move that drew criticism from Europe and Washington’s main Arab allies.

The relocation of the American embassy to Jerusalem had also generated condemnation from Palestine and led to the deaths of at least 41 persons.
