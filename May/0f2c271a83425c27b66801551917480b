A man has committed suicide at the University College Hospital (UCH) Ibadan, Oyo, while hospital’s workers are currently on strike.
He took the plunge from the staircase leading to the 6th floor of the University College Hospital, Ibadan, on Wednesday.
According to the hospital’s Public Relations Officer Deji Bobade, the man, whi was never a staffer or patient, came into the hospital around 9 am.
“Because of the ongoing strike of members of the Joint Health Sector Unions, we have less than 100 patients at the hospital and the place from where he jumped is not a ward. The staircase leads to the museum,” Bobade told the Punch.
He described the man as having tribl marks, wearing blue clothes and a pair of rubber slippers.
A suicide note, a mobile phone, and some money were also found on him by the police who took his corpse to a morgue.
