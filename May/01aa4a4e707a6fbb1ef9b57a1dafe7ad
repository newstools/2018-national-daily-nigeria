Mauricio Pochettino has committed himself to Tottenham by signing a new five-year contract.
The Argentinian, who has led Spurs to three successive top three Premier League finishes, has penned fresh terms reportedly worth £8.5million a year to keep him at the club until 2023.
The news will come as a welcome relief to chairman Daniel Levy after Pochettino appeared to cast doubt on his future at the end of the season by challenging the club to match his own ambition and “take risks” in the transfer window.
He held talks with Levy last week and they obviously went well, with Pochettino staying to guide Tottenham into their rebuilt White Hart Lane stadium next season.
He told the club’s official website: “I am honoured to have signed a new long-term contract as we approach one of the most significant periods in the club’s history and be the manager that will lead this team into our new world-class stadium.
“This is just one of the factors that makes this one of the most exciting jobs in world football and we are already making plans to ensure we continue to build on the great work that everyone has contributed to over the past four years.
“Daniel and I have spoken at length about our aspirations for this football club. We both share the same philosophies to achieve long-term, sustainable success.
“This is a special club – we always strive to be creative in the way we work both on and off the pitch and will continue to stick to our principles in order to achieve the success this club deserves.”
