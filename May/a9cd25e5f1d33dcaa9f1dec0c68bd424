The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has accused the Presidency if going to Benue State to solicit for the votes of the Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) ahead of the 2019 elections. Vice President Yemi Osinbajo who went on the trip on behalf of President Muhammadu Buhari disbursed N10 billion to the victims of the Fulani herdsmen killings and destruction of property, for the reconstruction of the destroyed farmlands and houses.
PDP in a statement on Wednesday accused Osinbajo, an ordained pastor, of attempting to “swindle votes” ahead of the 2019 elections, saying that his visit to the Abagana, Gbajimba and Anyii Internally Displaced Persons’ camps in Benue state was political.”
“It is a political attempt at window dressing the already damaged image of President Muhammadu Buhari administration and an insult to the grieving people of Benue State,” the PDP maintained.
The PDP stated that certain actions of Vice President Yemi Osinbajo “casts doubt” on his Christian faith, adding that he has been desperate to return for a second term with Buhari.
“Since the news of the cabal’s plan to pick a new running mate for Buhari ahead of the 2019 presidential election became public knowledge, Osinbajo has since shown a level of desperation that casts doubt publicly on his professed Christian faith,” the PDP said.
