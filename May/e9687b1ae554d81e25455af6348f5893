Former Senate Leader, Ali Ndume has accuses senate president, Bukola Saraki of targeting those who oppose him, saying he regretted supporting him when he emerged as the senate president.

Ali Ndume, who is representing Borno South disclosed this while speaking on Hard Copy, a Channels Television programme.

Recall that Ndume used to be a strong ally of Saraki until he was suspended for “embarrassing” Saraki and Dino Melaye, senator representing Kogi west.

Ndume had demanded that the upper legislative chamber investigate the allegation that a vehicle imported without appropriate customs documents belong to Saraki while he also moved for a probe into the allegations of certificate forgery levelled against Melaye.

During the television programme, Maupe Ogun, the presenter, had asked the senator if he regrets supporting the senate president and he said: “Yes, I do.  Look at the senate now, we have been reduced to unbearable level of integrity, just because of few people, few person, that is wrong.

Ndume said his relationship with Saraki went sour because of his love for the truth.

“I speak the truth a lot even if I’m alone, and I stand by it. We started with the issue of Magu, I was with you on national TV and that is history now, then we came out and the second issue was that of the car importation, and the issue of Dino Melaye’s certificate and then I was shockingly suspended for 180 days and it was not the committee that recommended that,” he said.

“I mean, it’s very unfortunate, I personally did not expect this. That is how we got it wrong, because once an individual thinks he owns the senate, and he dishes out the direction, and dishes out what he thinks, you’ll always get it wrong… 108 heads are better than one. But for now, senate at certain point is like Dino and Saraki. It is very unfortunate.”
