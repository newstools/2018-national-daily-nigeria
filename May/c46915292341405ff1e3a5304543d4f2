Gerom Media, the organisers of the Euro-Africa Forum, is arranging for delegates from Africa to also attend the WFS with both events offering increased networking and partnership opportunities.
According to Gerrit Davids, MD of Gerom Media. “It has come as no surprise that the WFS has in such a short space of time, became the world’s premier football convention and more than 2300 delegates from 80 countries have attended in 2017 engaging with 90 international football experts debating key issues on how to take the game to the next level  also the stature of WFS bears testimony to the fact that it has just renewed its partnership with LaLiga “to continue working together in the promotion and growth of global football”.
The inaugural Euro-Africa Football Partnership Forum, taking place a day after the WFS, will facilitate discussions on sustainable cooperation agreements between European and African football associations (FA’s), leagues, clubs, player unions, academies, elite coaches, agents and other football organisations respectively.
Davids said that with the recent launch of the African Football Alliance (AFA) in both Johannesburg and Lagos, Nigeria, “football stakeholders from the continent will have no better event on offer, where they could discuss and forge cooperation agreements, not only with Spanish football bodies, but also potentially with the likes of the European Clubs Association (ECA), which is lead by Andrea Agnelli, Chairman of Juventus”.
