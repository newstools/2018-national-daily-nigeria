Sen. Jonah Jang clasped in prison by a Plateau high court presided over by Justice Daniel Longji last week appears contented with his new life in prison.
Jang was said to have taken the pulpit on Sunday during a prison interdenominational service where he prayed and preachified his fellow inmates and visiting former commissioners that worked with him.
The 74-year-old was also said to have got so sparky during the week he joined other football-loving jailbirds in a five-aside.
And while the serving senator was having a rollicking time in jail, his colleagues in the upper house, former VP Atiku Abubakar, Prof. Jerry Gana, Chris Giwa, and some PDP stalwarts swarmed in in solidarity visits.
As part of their good deeds of the day, the visiting senators and commissioners rained down wads of Naira notes on the inmates, settled bills, and plunked down monies for the prison upkeep.
The EFCC alleged Jang and a former cashier in the office of the Secretary to the Plateau State Government, Yusuf Pam, misused the state’s intervention fund granted by the CBN.
The offences were said to have been perpetrated few months to the end of Jang’s tenure as governor in 2015.
Jang and Pam pleaded not guilty to the 12-count charge.
Justice Longji will rule on their bail application May 24.
