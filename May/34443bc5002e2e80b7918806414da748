The Ekiti State House of Assembly has impeached and removed its Deputy Speaker, Segun Adewumi, for alleged “gross misconduct.”
It also removed the Chief Whip, Akinniyi Sunday, from Ikere 2 and replaced him with Olawale Onigiobi from Ekiti South West 1.
The Assembly accused Adewumi of committing several acts including personal conducts likely to bring the Assembly to disrepute, obvious threat to peace of members and obstruction of constitutional functions of ‘The House.’
He was also accused of “dereliction, desertion, abscondment and abandonment of constitutional vested responsibilities of the Office of the Deputy Speaker.”
The chairman, House Committee on Information, Dr. Samuel Omotoso, stated that Adewumi was removed at the Plenary, with a division list signed by two-thirds majority members and unanimously passed by the House as required by law.
“The House, in its resolution, also mandated the Clerk to ensure that the former Deputy Speaker hands over all property of the House with immediate effect,” he said.
Omotoso said further that the Assembly considered the unopposed nomination of Sina Animasaun, Ekiti West 2, as the New Deputy Speaker.
Animasaun, a native of Okemesi-Ekiti, is a 1991 Graduate of Biochemistry from the Ekiti State University.
He is a Chartered Advert Practitioner and a Public Relations Consultant with several years of experience in Public and Political Administration.
