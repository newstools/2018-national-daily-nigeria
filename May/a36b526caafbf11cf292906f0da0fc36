The sole rival of Gov. Ayp Fayoseâ€™sanointed candidate and National Publicity Secretary of Peoples Democratic Party, Dayo Adeyeye, has announced his resignation from the PDP after losing Tuesday primary to Dep. Gov. Kolapo Olusola.
He alleged irregularities.
The election, orgainsed by the Gov. Ifeanyi Okowa-led committee, was adjudged free and fair by the party.
Adeyeye scored 770 in spite of the third contestant Sen. Abiodun Olujimi stepping down and joining forces with him.
Olusola, however, polled 1,191 to defeat the former minister of state for works.
Adeyeye left the venue of the election in a huff, before the result was announced, though he was said to have confided in the election committee he accepted the result.
But he announced his resignation from the party Thursday after a meeting with loyalists and supporters at his campaign office in Ado Ekiti
