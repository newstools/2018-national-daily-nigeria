Heads have begun to roll as the APC concluded its Ekiti guber primary screening in which a dark horse, Bimbola Daramola, outshines 23 other contestants screened, including Solid Minerals Minister Kayode Fayemi, a former governor of the state.

Going by the yardsticks used for the screening report, a copy of which the National Daily obtained, Daramola carried everything before him: 13 years in the party, no defection, substantial contribution to the party, and no legal luggage.

Most importantly, he has the best rating in street credibility: very remarkable.

Other contestants are mostly unknown or viable in that respect.

Daramola was once a collation officer at the ACN guber rerun in 2009 , and a member of the House of Reps between 2011 and 2015.

However, Fayemi, who many believe is the contestant to beat in the May 4 primary election, had a poor showing in the legal department, and the credibility rating.

He was rated as “average, with lots of issues with the party and stakeholders, detached, and soundly defeated in all the state LGAs” when he was governor.

Other contestants also considered as heavyweights in the race are, however, missing in the screening.

Former Gov. Segun Oni, Babafemi Ojudu, a presidential aide on political affairs, and Bamidele Opeyemi did not appear in the result.

It is not unclear yet whether they have stepped down or not.

The party had attempted to head off any impending crisis before the the May 4 primary.

The 24 contestants met at Marina, Lagos, last week, with the party national leader Bola Tinubu who, sources say, is not keen on Fayemi’s candidacy.

But the minister is said to have his back covered by the estranged loyalists of Tinubu’s including Ondo Gov. Rotimi Akeredolu and others.
