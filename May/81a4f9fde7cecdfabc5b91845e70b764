Real Madrid midfielder, Toni Kroos, has admitted that they were not the best team against Bayern Munich, in the second leg of their semi-final clash on Tuesday night.
Joshua Kimmich put Bayern in front at the Santiago Bernabeu, before Karim Benzema scored a brace. James Rodriguez’s equalizer was not enough to take the Germans through.
Kroos insists they were more effective than the Bundesliga champions.
“Perhaps we weren’t the best team, but we were more effective.
“They produced some great football and created many chances.
“We definitely had more of the ball than last week.
“We are delighted, we knew it wasn’t going to be easy to qualify for the final.
“Here we are again, Bayern played very well in both matches, but Real Madrid are the ones in the final.
“We deserve this, we’ve worked hard all season,” he told reporters after the game,” he said.
