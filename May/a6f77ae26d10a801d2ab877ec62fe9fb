The Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) has denied being responsible for the accidental death of a teenager simply identified as Kofo during Saturday’s local government election in Oyo state.
Kofo was said to have been hit by a stray bullet at Idi Oro area of Ibadan, the state capital.
According to findings by National Daily, the girl was said to have gone to a pharmaceutical shop to buy some drugs when she met her untimely death.
It was gathered from residents that some hoodlums were fomenting trouble in the area when personnel of the NSCDC in the state were called in to quell the violence.
The residents alleged that the girl was killed by a stray bullet belonging to the NSCDC in the ensuing clash.
The hoodlums thereafter attacked the NSCDC divisional office in Ibadan North West local government council at Ekotedo, vandalising the premises.
It was gathered that officers of the NSCDC later mobilised and repelled the attack.
Olusegun Oluwole, spokesman of the NSCDC in the state who confirmed the incident, said men of the command were not responsible for the killing of the teenager.
Oluwole said the hoodlums were already shooting before the arrival of the NSCDC team, adding that the case was now under investigation by the police.
“Our men are not responsible for what happened, but I can tell you now that the case is with the police,” he said.
