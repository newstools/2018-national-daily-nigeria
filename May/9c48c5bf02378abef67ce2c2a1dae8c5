A 104-year-old Australian scientist who travelled to Switzerland to end his life committed assisted suicide on Thursday, the foundation which helped him die said
David Goodall, who had been barred from seeking help to end his life in his home country, did not have a terminal illness but said his quality of life had deteriorated significantly and that he wanted to die.
Wearing a sweatshirt with the slogan ‘Ageing Disgracefully’, he addressed a press conference Wednesday on the eve of his death to explain his decision.
“I am rather surprised at the wide internet in my case. I am very appreciative of the hospitality of the Swiss federation and the ability which one has here to come to an end gracefully,” he told reporters.
“I am happy to have this chance, though I would have preferred to have had it in Australia, and I greatly regret that Australia is behind Switzerland in this move, and that most countries are in fact behind Switzerland.
“One wants at my age, and even rather less than my age, one wants to be free to chose their death at an appropriate time.
“My abilities have been declining over the past year or two – well, my eyesight has, for the past five or six years.
“I no longer want to continue life. I am happy to have the chance tomorrow (Thursday) to end it and I appreciate the help of the medical profession here in making that possible.”
He assured the gathered press that he had no regrets about the decision he had made.
Dr. Goodall, who was born in Britain but lived for much of his life in Australia.
