Former Governor of Edo State, Adams Oshiomhole, on Wednesday announced that he would declare his bid for the national chairmanship of All Progressives Congress (APC) in Abuja on Thursday.
He told journalists in Benin City that President of the Senate, Bukola Saraki and House of Representatives Speaker, Yakubu Dogara, would join top members of the party at the occasion.
Saraki has been known to have closed ranks with the party chairman John Oyegun in the wake of the chairman’s fall-out with the APC national leader BolaTinubu in 2016.
It will surprise many political observers that the Senate president is now gracing the declaration of Oshiomhole, known to be a Tinubu’s ally, who will be slugging it out with Oyegun seeking a second term.
Many of the APC governors were also solidly behind Oyegun when their party leader and President Muhammadu Buhari said Oyegun’s tenure elongation was illegal.
The tide appeared to have moved against the 79 year-old now as his former governor wants same job.
Mr Oshiomhole said that Imo Governor, Rochas Okorocha, would lead governors elected on the party’s platform to the declaration which would hold at TRANSCORP Hilton.
The former governor is favoured to replace outgoing chairman of the party, John Odigie-Oyegun, after he received the endorsement of President Muhammadu Buhari.
Mr Oshiomhole said he was joining the chairmanship race to contribute to the growth of the party.
According to him, it is true that I intend to make my ambition known to our party members and Nigerians.
“I strongly believe that with the experience I have gathered in my public life, having served as President of NLC, governor of Edo, I have what it takes to take our dear party, the ruling party, to the next level.”
