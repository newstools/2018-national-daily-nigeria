Inspector-General of Police Ibrahim Idris has, for the third time, ignored the invitation by the Senate, and the upper house cannot be madder with him.
While he sent his AIG Joshak Habila the first two times, the IGP simply igmored the third invitation on Wednesday.
Idris has been summoned to address the Senate on the police treatment of Senator Dino Melaye during his arrest and detention for gun-running allegations–and to also brief the house on the spate of killings by armed herdsmen and militias across the nation.
Sen. President Bukola Saraki , after a closed door session, had to declare the top cop a persona non grata.
Other senators took the floor to express their frustration.
Majority Leader Ahmad Lawan said efforts he made to reach out to the IG failed.
He described the non-appearance as “unusual and unfortunate.”
“We need to take a very drastic action. We cannot take this embarrassment any longer. This is a national disgrace,” Sen. Emmanuel Bwacha said.
Senator Isa Misau put up a superiority argument, saying a senator is superior to the IG by the provisions of the Constitution.
Accirding to him, sections 88 and 89 of the Constitution empowers the legislature to summon the police boss.
He said the refusal is embarrassing to the country and President Muhammadu Buhari.
Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe said Nigeria’s democracy is dying in bits and that the IG’s non-appearance is an abuse of government power.
