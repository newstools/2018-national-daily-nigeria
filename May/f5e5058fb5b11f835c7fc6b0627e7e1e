A federal high court in Abuja will today, Wednesday 30, deliver judgement in a N1.64 billion alleged fraud case brought against former Taraba state governor, Rev. Jolly Nyame by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC).

The EFCC had charged Nyame on June 22, 2010 on a 21-count charge bordering on misappropriation of funds to the tune of N1.64 billion while in office.

Recall that after the adoption of final written addresses on February 28, Justice Adebukola Banjoko adjourned the matter toMay 30 for judgment.

National Daily gathered that Nyame’s counsel, Olalekan Ojo, had earlier told the court that the confessional statement which the EFCC relied upon was marred by inconsistency. He thus urged the court to discountenance it.

According to him, no witness in the course of the protracted trial testified or brought out any evidence to prove that Nyame diverted any funds as governor of Taraba state.

But the EFCC counsel, Rotimi Jacobs (SAN), explained that the prosecution called fourteen relevant witnesses to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. He added that Nyame’s statement reproduced as evidence supported the prosecution in the case.
