Widely regarded as one of the top pundits in the business, Sky Sports’ Gary Neville has put forward his Premier League team of the season.
With Man City comfortably claiming the title this year, it’s no surprise that Neville has included several key components of their success with no less than five of Pep Guardiola’s stars being included, as noted in his Sky Sports column.
However, while there can be no debate over the like of Kevin De Bruyne, Kyle Walker and Raheem Sterling who have all had impressive campaigns, question marks have been raised by fans over Vincent Kompany’s inclusion, as seen in the tweets below.
The 32-year-old has only made 16 Premier League appearances this season due to injury problems, and while there is no denying that he is fundamental when fit as pointed out by Neville, that’s surely not enough games to warrant a place in this XI.
Further, while Andy Robertson has certainly impressed for Liverpool in recent months, he didn’t break into the side until halfway through the season, and so it’s questionable as to whether that’s enough playing time too.
