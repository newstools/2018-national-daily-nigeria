The Nigeria Police and the Nigerian Navy clashed in Lagos over movement of a tanker on the Ijora-Badia Bridge to Apapa Wharf.
An eye-witness account said it all started when some Naval rating personnel were escorting a tanker from Western Avenue to Apapa which was stopped by the policemen for failing to be on queue like others.
The incident had angered one of the Naval personnel who immediately slapped one of the police officers.
He was joined by others who dealt a big blow on the two police officers. The two police officers, identified as Sergeant Tunde and another, Mogbojuri, were said to have sustained injuries as a result of the fight.
The uniform of one of the police officers was said to be torn during the fight. Although no casualty was recorded, passers-by, including transporters had avoided the scene for fear of stray-bullet.
