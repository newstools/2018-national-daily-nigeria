Olagunsoye Oyinlola, a former governor of Osun, says he is leaving the ruling party, the All Progressives Congress (APC).
He has also resigned his appointment as chairman of the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC).
Oyinlola, in a resignation letter dated May 9, and addressed to President Muhammadu Buhari, said he resigned his appointment to “chart a new course in my politics outside the ruling party”.
“I gave the job the dedication it deserved and would have loved to continue but I regret to inform Your Excellency that I have a new, greater political engagement that will make that difficult and even impolitic, Oyinlola stated in the letter.
“The training I got as a decorated officer and gentleman precluded me from engaging in any act that could amount to disloyalty and conflict of interest.
“I am moving on to chart a new course in my politics outside the ruling party and this thus, demands my dropping the NIMC chairmanship.
“For me, the time to work on something else in the interest and service of our people is now. I wish Your Excellency good luck while praying that you will finish well and strong in the service of our country.”
Recall that Oyinlola who was appointed as NIMC Chairman by President Buhari on September 2017 had jointly signed a letter on Thursday on behalf of the New Peoples’ Democratic Party (nPDP), a coalition of PDP leaders who had defected to the APC in 2013.
In the petition addressed to the National Chairman of the APC, nPDP gave the ruling party a 7-day ultimatum in which to address what the group described as total neglect in the scheme of things by President Muhammadu Buhari.
