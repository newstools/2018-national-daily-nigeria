Arsene Wenger says that in the future the Premier League will be played in midweek because the weekends will consist of football from a European Super League.
The Arsenal boss was reflecting on what has changed in English football since he arrived in 1996 and what might happen in the future.
Wenger will take charge of his final match on Sunday, and usually his predictions about football are quite astute, so the game we know right now could look very different in a few years time.
Touching on the club he joined 22 years ago, he said, “When I arrived, we were 80 at Arsenal.
“We are now, today, 700. From a private little company where you know everybody we have gone to a normal company with an HR department where everything has to be processed, regulated.
“It’s not down anymore to your initiative, every single decision has to go through a process that is [the result of] an over regulated society.
“That’s sometimes discouraging as the human aspect has dropped a little bit. On the other hand, the financial power of the clubs has become huge. On the other hand, in 20 years the ownership has changed completely.
