Liverpool’s new signing Fabinho “ticks all the boxes” but Jurgen Klopp needs to sign three more players, according to former Chelsea striker Tony Cascarino.
The Reds completed the signing of the Brazilian for £43.7million on Monday with rumours that Lyon’s Nabil Fekir and Roma’s Alisson could follow him in the door this summer.
And Cascarino has identified three positions that Liverpool need to strengthen if they are to compete at the top of the Premier League next season.
On signing Fabinho, Cascarino told talkSPORT: “He ticks all the boxes.
“He can be a holding midfielder, he can be versatile and you can play him in other positions like at full-back.
