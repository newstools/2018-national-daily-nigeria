Rivers United technical manager, Stanley Eguma has voiced his sentiments ahead of Sunday’s Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) game against champions, Plateau United.
The two sides go toe to toe in Port Harcourt in one of the stand out fixtures of match day 22 of this season’s NPFL with crucial points up for grabs.
Eguma is full of respect for the opposition but insists his charges will deliver a big performance at the Yakubu Gowon Stadium as he sets his sights on the ‘Pride of Rivers’ amassing maximum points.
“We know that it is going to be a tough game,” Eguma told  National Daily
“Plateau United are the champions and they are not pushovers but we have resolved to pick up the three points at stake.
“We have been working very hard and since we retunred from our trip to Maiduguri (where United drew 1-1 with El Kanemi Warriors in their last NPFL game six days ago).
“We have shifted our attention to this game against Plateau United and I must tell you that the spirit in camp is high.
Rivers United is currently in ninth place on the NPFL standings with 29 points from 21 matches while Plateau United, currently in second place on the log have amassed 36 points from the same number of matches.
