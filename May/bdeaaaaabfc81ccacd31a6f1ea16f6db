Counsel to the former National Publicity Secretary of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Olisa Metuh, Mr. Emeka Etiaba, (SAN) has made a return back today to continue defending the embattled politician this came Barely 24 hours after he announced his withdrawal as a defence lawyer.
The ex-PDP spokesperson had collapsed during yesterday’s proceedings, but was absent today from the ongoing court session, Etiaba announced himself as the lawyer to the ex-spokesperson for the PDP.
Etiaba had withdrawn from the case yesterday after the judge insisted that the trial must continue after Metuh’s fall in court.
But the judge, Justice Okon Abang, had overruled Etiaba’s application to withdraw from the case, saying it was an attempt to delay the case.
‎Insisting that he had withdrawn from the case, Etiaba refused to answer further questions asked by the judge even after the ruling dismissing his application for withdrawal from the case.
The judge described Etiaba’s attitude as rude and unethical.
The judge, however, adjourned the case till Tuesday after the court’s medical official said Metuh needed to see his doctor.
Metuh, who with his company, Destra Investment Limited, are being prosecuted by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission for the N400m he allegedly received fraudulently from the Office of the National Security Adviser in 2014,  fell after taking some steps towards the dock on yesterday.
