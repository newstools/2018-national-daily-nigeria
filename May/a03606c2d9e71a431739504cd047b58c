The Anambra State Police Command has arrested a 52-year-old man for allegedly killing his 82-year-old mother, Roseline Okadigbo, gouging her eyes, and removing her heart..
The first son of the victim, Mr. Innocent Okadigbo, said he had a “strong suspicion” that his younger brother Christopher’s motive was to use their mother for ritual.
According to him, the late mother reported to him 24 hours before her death about the suspicious moves of Christopher and one Udolu around her apartment.
“My mother added that she was afraid of staying alone in her house due to the kind of utterances she overheard from the two men.
“In less than 24 hours after my mother’s apprehensive telephone call to me, I received another call from one Pius Aniefule that my mother was found dead in a pool of blood,” he said.
Christopher, who stopped relating with his brother since 1999 also called to inform him about the incident.
He said he travelled to Minna, Niger State, where people at home broke the news to him.
The President General of the Nando community, Mr Ignatius Aghadinuno, said he met Roseline’s corpse on the ground.
“Because of the massive beating Udolu had received, I pleaded with the people not to lynch him. I invited security operatives who later arrested Udolu,” he added.
He said Christopher was later caught hiding in the home of a native doctor close to the community.
No official statment from the police yet.
But Christopher has been arrested along with his accomplice.
