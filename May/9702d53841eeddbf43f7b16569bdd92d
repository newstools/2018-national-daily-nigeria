Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State has demonstrated a paradigm shift from the conduct of local government election in Nigeria where the ruling political party often wins all the local councils. The governor has proved that the opposition political party also has areas of dominance and should be respected accordingly, culminating the All Progressives Congress (APC) winning 14 of the 18 local governments in Kaduna State and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) wining four.
The Kaduna State Independent Electoral Commission, on Thursday, ratified the results for 18 chairmanship seats out of the 23 Local Governments in the May 12 local government election.
KASIEC Chairman, Dr. Saratu Dikko, declared that APC won 14 local government chairmanship seats, while the PDP won four seats.
Dikko said the commission would hold elections in the remaining five local government areas on Saturday, June 2, 2018.
The KASIEC Chairman highlighted that APC won in Birnin-Gwari, Giwa, Igabi, Ikara, Kaduna North, Sabon-Gari, Kagarko,Kubau,  Kudan, Lere, Makarfi, Sanga, Soba and Zaria, while the PDP won in Jema’a, Kachia, Kauru and Zango-Kataf.
Dikko said Kaura, Jaba and Kajuru local governments would hold fresh elections on June 2.
She stated that the pending elections in four wards in Chikun and two wards in Kaduna South local governments would also hold on the same day.
She said Certificates of Return would be issued to the winners on Saturday, May 19, 2018.
