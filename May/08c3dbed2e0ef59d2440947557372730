Manchester City winger, Raheem Sterling believes Nigeria will be formidable opponents when they face off at Wembley in a pre-World Cup friendly on June 2.
Super Eagles stars, Victor Moses and Kelechi Iheanacho will not be new to Sterling as they both play in the Premier League and were teammates with him at Liverpool and Manchester City respectively.
“I probably got more ticket requests than I have any game at Wembley, that’s for sure,” Raheem Sterling told Extratimesoccerlive
“I think we got a great physical team but I know for the fact that the Nigerian team will be as physical as us and technical as us but it’s going to be a game of the day.
“It is a friendly but I don’t think it would be a friendly game because both teams are really going to get prepared and be ready.”
