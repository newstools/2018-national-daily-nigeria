Levante welcomed Barcelona to the Estadi Ciutat de Valencia on Sunday evening comfortable in the knowledge that their LaLiga statius is secure, and with the handbrakes off Emmanuel Boateng scored the first hat-trick of his career.
After spending three seasons in the Portuguese Primeira Liga before arriving in Spain, the Ghana-born forward has never before hit the milestone.
His tally of three goals on Sunday evening took his haul for the season to six, a return that is nevertheless disappointing when you consider how high hopes were for him when he arrived at the club.
Despite this, Boateng has saved his better performances for the big occasions and his hat-trick against the Blaugrana will live long in the memory, but it must also be remembered that he scored against Real Madrid earlier this season.
