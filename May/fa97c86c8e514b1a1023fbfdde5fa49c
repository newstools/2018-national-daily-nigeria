Imo Gov. Rochas Okorocha has apparently got his influence over the party’s state structure whittled down, and he is now remembering the good old days in APGA before it merged with the APC.
He, however, still believes the APGA, having him, is strong enough for 2019.
Okorocha said this at the Imo government house chapel in Owerri, while he was addressing Imo youths, on the day of the APC state congress.
“In the days of APGA and how we were able to win victory despite the fact that all the political Juggernauts were not on our side,” he said.
“There was an incumbent governor, by name Ohakim, with a presidential PDP, with all the Army but we resisted them and won them.
“We didn’t have to leave APGA, if we were in APGA, we would have still won our election.
He praised the youth in his rabble-rousing, and condemned the Ifeanyi Ararume-led faction of the APC whose members were not there from the beginning.
“But in APC, these men came and deceived my deputy governor and former SGI and commissioners and took them away,” he said.
The governor landed himself in trouble when he stretched his luck too far by plotting to install his son-in-law and chief of staff Uche Nwosu as his successor in the next guber election.
The action has created a thick wall of enmity between him and the party at the state levelm and his relationship with the party’s national chairman John Oyegun dims the chances for a come-back.
