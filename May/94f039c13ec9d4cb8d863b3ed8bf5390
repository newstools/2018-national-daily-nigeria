Detectives from the Force Headquarters, Abuja investigating the Offa bank robbery which claimed no fewer than 50 lives including 10 Policemen said they are close to arresting the remaining two key gang leaders that carried out the operation.
The disclosure came from a senior detective involved in the investigation barely 24 hours after the team arrested two out of the four gang leaders that were earlier declared wanted by the Nigeria Police Force over the robbery of April 2, 2018. The Police had yesterday announced the arrest of two of the major suspects: Kunle Ogunleye, aka Arrow (35), a native of Oro town in Kwara State and Michael Adikwu, a dismissed Police Corporal and convict.
No fewer than 22 of the suspects are presently being interrogated at the Force Headquarters.
The Force Police Public  Relations Officer, Moshood Jimoh, an Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP) had in a statement yesterday in Abuja said that the two leaders of the robberies were arrested two weeks ago, adding that they had confessed to their roles in the heist and would soon be arraigned in court.
He said, “Following the publication of the pictures of the participants of the Offa bank robberies in the media, we have been getting several credible leads from members of the public and as a result, members of the Intelligence Response Team deployed by the IGP in Kwara, Ondo, Osun, Oyo and Ekiti states were able to arrest two more gang leaders of the bank robberies.”
The Police image maker urged the public to volunteer more information about other suspects at large, assuring that the safety of informants was guaranteed.
“Protection of the informant will be guaranteed by the police and handsome rewards, in addition to the pledge of N5m by the Kwara State Government, awaits anyone whose information leads to the arrest of these wanted suspects,” Jimoh said.
