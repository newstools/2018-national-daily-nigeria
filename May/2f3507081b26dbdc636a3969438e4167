Leicester City defensive midfielder Wilfred Ndidi was named Young Player of the Year for the Foxes at their award dinner held recently in England.
The Nigerian international has been the main man in the holding midfield position for Claude Puel’s side this season.
The 21-year-old also narrowly missed being named the club’s Player of the Season at the King Power Stadium as he came second behind Harry Maguire.
Ndidi signed for Leicester City from Genk in the January transfer window of 2017 to fill the void for N’Golo Kante who left for Chelsea.
According to Opta Stats, Ndidi has had the most successful tackles in the top five leagues in Europe as the youngster is having an incredible season.
That is why a number of Premier League clubs have been linked to the Super Eagles player including Manchester United and Liverpool.
Ndidi was injured in the Foxes 5-0 loss to Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park over the weekend as the his side remain ninth on the league table.
The former U-20 international has cemented a place in the Gernot Rohr’s starting XI since the German coach was appointed the national team coach.
All through Nigeria’s qualifiers to the World Cup Ndidi has been a constant figure in the midfield providing cover for the attack.
As the World Cup in Russia is fast approaching Ndidi’s current form will be a major boost for the Super Eagles at the Mundial.
Nigeria will play Croatia, Iceland and Argentina in Group D when the competition starts proper in the summer.
