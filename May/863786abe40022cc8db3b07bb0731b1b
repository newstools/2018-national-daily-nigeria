Rafael Nadal will face Novak Djokovic in the semi-final blockbuster at the Internazionali BNL d’Italia semi-finals.
Nadal stayed on track to reclaim the world number one ranking after recovering from a set down to defeat Fabio Fognini in their last-eight meeting in Rome.
Djokovic then saw off Kei Nishikori to book what will be a 51st career meeting – an open-era record – against his old foe Nadal.
Nadal, currently ranked two behind another great rival, Roger Federer, beat home favourite Fognini 4-6 6-1 6-2.
The Italian world number 21 threatened an upset as he won the final five games of the first set after trailing 4-1.
But Nadal broke serve at the start of the second set and thereafter was always in control, with Fognini needing treatment for a knee problem before succumbing to defeat.
Djokovic, who is now ranked 18th, also had to come from behind to claim a 2-6 6-1 6-3 victory over Nishikori. It put him through to his first semi-final of 2018.
