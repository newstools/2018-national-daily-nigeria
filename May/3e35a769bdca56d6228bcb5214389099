The abductors of a Customs officer attached to the Federal Operations Unit (FOU) Zone A of the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS), Rasheed Abdulsalam, are yet to establish contact with the Customs management for any ransom, two weeks after the incident, National Daily  has gathered.

Abdulsalam was allegedly abducted penultimate Saturday by suspected smugglers at Sango Otta, Ogun State.

The abducted officer was said to have been on anti-smuggling operation along with other Customs operatives in the area before the team was attacked.

A customs source who spoke with the press at the weekend said, “Since the incident happened, we have not heard anything from the kidnappers. We are still hoping the kidnappers will say something on ransom but they have not said anything about it.”

The source disclosed that no fewer than eight suspects have so far been arrested by the police in Abeokuta, Ogun State, based on information gathered from the Customs Intelligent Unit (CIU) in connection to the abduction.

When contacted, Customs Public Relations Officer, Joseph Attah, said in a text message that efforts were on to secure the release of the officer.
