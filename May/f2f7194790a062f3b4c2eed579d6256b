The Egbura National Development Association has fingered the Bassa community in Kogi and Nasarawa states of being perpetrators of the recent attacks against the the Egbura people.

Recall that not less than fifteen people were killed in a communal clash that happened between the Bassa and Egbura ethnic groups in Umaisha town, Toto local government area of Nasarawa state.

Describing the attacks as a form of genocide, it alleged that the attacks have political undertones, and urged the affected state governors to take proactive measures and end the mayhem.

The group made the disclosure in a statement signed by its national president, Ibrahim Aguye and secretary, Yusuf Aboki; following the foiled daylight attack on Umaisha community in Nasarawa state at the weekend.

ENDA alleged that the attacks have political undertones, and urged the affected state governors to end the mayhem by taking proactive measures.

“Apart from Ugya which has experienced sustained attacks by Bassa mercenaries, surrounding villages such as Kolo, Katakpa and Ogba have also come under attacks on different days, as well as many other Egbura communities in Toto LGA which are still experiencing guerilla styled attacks, while lives as well as properties are being lost,” the statement said.

 “We are constrained to give the concerned authorities some promising lead that would prove useful on the timeline of their campaigns of carnage and terror which has seen them raiding various Egbura communities of Toto LGA.”
 
In particular, ENDA urged the Nasarawa state government to “unmask the masquerades behind the latest crisis which we have every reason to believe, has political undertone.”

It also called on the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) and Nasarawa State Emergency Management Agency (NASEMA) to come to the aid of the Egbura indigenes who had been displaced by the attacks.
