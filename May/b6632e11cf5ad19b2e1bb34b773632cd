The summer of 2006 is widely remembered for Zinedine Zidane’s retirement and spectacular departure from the international scene, yet after his resignation as Real Madrid coach on Thursday, it’s recalled how he also left them as a player in 2006 despite having one year left on his contract.
His final match for the club came against Villarreal and the club prepared several tributes to the Frenchman, including a mosaic with his number five being held up by supporters.
Los Blancos even utilised a unique shirt for that match back in May 2006.
Every single shirt was embroidered with the words ‘Zidane 2001-2006’ under the club crest.
It was just 12 days prior to that occasion that the midfielder shocked the world when he announced his retirement from football to Canal +, and nobody in the Spanish capital saw it coming.
He still had a year left on his playing contract and many expected him to see it through, however, he left after making a very private decision.
This isn’t entirely dissimilar to the situation at the Estadio Santiago Bernabeu on May 31, 2018, with the Frenchman leaving his post as coach behind, despite the fact his contract actually had two years left to run on it this time around.
