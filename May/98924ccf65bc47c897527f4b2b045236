At least 19 members of the Joint Health Sector Union (JOHESU) sustained injuries in an accident along the Benin-Auchi Road on Saturday.

The workers are said to be staff of the University of Benin Teaching Hospital (UBTH) chapter of the union.

According to Channels, 40 of the health workers were on their way to a function in Auchi when the accident occurred.
The injured victims were subsequently rushed to the Otibho Okhai Hospital in Irrua, Edo state, where they were being treated by doctors and consultants on duty.

Esteem Tagar, president of the association of resident doctors at Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital, who confirmed the incident, said no life was lost in the accident.

The union has been on strike since April 17.

Part of the health workers’ demands include upward review of their salaries to be at same level with the doctors, a request both the federal government and the doctors kicked against.

Others are improved facilities, employment of additional health professionals, implementation of court judgments, upward review of retirement age from 60 to 65 years, and harmonization of salaries of all healthcare workers in the country.
 
The National Industrial Court in Abuja, on Thursday, ordered the health workers to resume work within 24 hours but JOHESU asked its members to continue with the strike.

The union has “relaxed” its strike in Lagos, Kano, Yobe and Niger states, but called on President Muhammadu Buhari to sack Isaac Adewole, minister of health, for allegedly taking sides with doctors in the ongoing strike.
