Real Madrid striker, Karim Benzema has equalled Lionel Messi’s record of goals in the Champions League semi-final in their 4-3 aggregate win over Bayern Munich on Tuesday.
One was a smart header, the other a tap-in as simple as any, and Karim Benzema’s two-goal salvo on Tuesday night put him on four goals in Champions League semi-finals.
Having previously scored in the 2012/13 defeat to Borussia Dortmund and a year later in the first leg beating of Bayern Munich, it means the Frenchman now has as many strikes in this round as Lionel Messi.
Whereas the Barcelona star has four from 13 games, Benzema managed to reach the tally in just his 12th semi-final appearance.
Messi stole the show as the Blaugrana opened up a 3-0 first leg lead, also versus Bayern, in 2014/15 and notched twice versus Madrid in 2010/11.
