Daniel Ricciardo survived a reliability scare to hold off Sebastian Vettel and take his second win of the 2018 Formula 1 season in the Monaco Grand Prix.
Ricciardo made no secret of his disgust at missing out on the win two years ago after a botched pit-stop cost him dearly.
But it was the perfect race from the Australian this time round, leading from start to finish to take the chequered flag.
Sebastian Vettel threatened at times but never got close enough to challenge while Lewis Hamilton picked up the final podium spot.
Ricciardo’s reaction – ” think I can show emotion today than yesterday,” he said. “This is two years in the making so I finally feel like the redemption has arrived.
We had problems. We had a lot to deal with during the race. I felt a loss of power and I thought the race was done. I got home just using six gears.
