Former Watford star Odion Ighalo might not leave his relegated team Changchun Yatai when the January transfer window reopens.
So far, he has scored 21 league goals in the Chinese Super League last term to finish second in the top scorers’ chart behind Shanghai SIPG’s Lei Wu who scored 27 goals.
In Africa, he remains the top scorer in the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers with six goals, including five in the home and away games against Libya.
Super Eagles are already through to next year’s African Cup of Nations tournament with a game to spare.
They top Group E with ten points from five matches, a point ahead of second-placed South Africa seeking a point in their final group game against Libya in Sfax to qualify.
