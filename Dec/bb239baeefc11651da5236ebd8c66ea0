Barcelona are losing hope in their pursuit of Ajax defender Matthijs de Ligt, according to Mundo Deportivo.
Though the Blaugrana remain confident of signing De Ligt’s club-mate Frenkie de Jong, they are struggling to make a breakthrough when it comes to agreeing a move for the centre-back.
Mino Raiola’s presence as De Ligt’s agent is complicating matters further, and they may now look elsewhere for defensive reinforcements.
