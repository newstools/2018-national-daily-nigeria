Raheem Sterling’s winner against Bournemouth for Manchester City saw the England man make history as he became the first player to score in his first six appearances against a single opponent in the Premier League.

National Daily learnt that the 23-year-old helped the Sky Blues on to a 3-1 win after Callum Wilson’s strike had cancelled out Bernardo Silva’s early effort in the first half, with Ilkay Gundogan adding a third late on to seal the deal.

Victory at the Etihad Stadium now means that City are five points clear, for the moment, of title rivals Liverpool and Chelsea, with Pep Guardiola’s side looking set to lead the charge into Christmas atop the table.

Sterling, whose contribution takes him to eight in the top flight this campaign, has been in sensational form for both club and country in recent months, playing a key role in helping England to a Nations League Final appearance last month.
