Former Chelsea and Nigeria Midfielder John Obi Mikel has launched a talent hunt series.
Dubbed “Africa’s Next Football Superstar”, the series will discover young talent that can be properly nurtured.
The hunt will take place in three African nations: Nigeria, South Africa, and Algeria.
They will be tested and narrowed down to nine who will have the privilege of going on an all-expenses-paid trip to the UK where they will get trials with top English clubs for a period spanning two weeks, with a chance to bag a one-year contract with the club’s youth team.
The trials in Nigeria will be held in Lagos on March 15th 2019, Port Harcourt on 18th, and Abuja on 20th. The finals are scheduled for May 2-9 2019.
John Obi Mikel after leaving Chelsea has been playing for Tianjin Teda in China.
He recently retired from the Super Eagles after returning from the world cup in Russia.
Kids between the ages of 13 and 16 will be eligible for the series, and five winners will be selected from each of the three countries.
