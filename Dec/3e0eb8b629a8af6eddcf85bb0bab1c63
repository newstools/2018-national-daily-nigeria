The 2018 Global Terrorism Index (GTI) latest report which named Nigeria as the third most terrorized nation in the world may discourage foreign investors from the country, economy experts have argued.
The new index placed Nigeria after war-torn countries like Iraq, Afghanistan and ahead of Syria and Pakistan.
Economy experts say the new data is a source of worry for the all efforts at wooing foreign deep pocket investors into the economy that is in dire need of investors in several sectors including telecoms, oil and gas, energy and housing development.
The report also showed that there is a drop in the number of deaths linked to terrorism. The report said, “Total deaths from terrorism in Nigeria fell to 1,532 in 2017, a drop of 16% from the previous year.”
Whereas the 2018 GTI revealed a continuing trend of a decline in terrorism, with deaths from terrorism falling for the third consecutive year, after peaking in 2014, analysts say it was not clear if the report considered the impacts of terror Fulani herdsmen who are momentarily attacking local farmers and carrying out kidnapping criminalities.
GTI also averred that though the global impact from terrorism is on the decline, it also shows that terrorism is still widespread and even getting worse in some regions.
Nigeria has been battling with Boko Haram terrorists in the northeast for several years now and has come to battle incessant killings orchestrated by herdsmen which the government has ignored several calls for their proscription.
Recently, Nigerian troops suffered one of the bloodiest attacks from Boko Haram at Metele Military taskforce base in Borno State where reports say scores of helpless troops were killed when insurgents overran the barracks.
