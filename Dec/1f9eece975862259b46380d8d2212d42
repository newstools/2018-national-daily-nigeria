The Spanish Prime Minister, Pedro Sanchez has revealed that Spain and Morocco are discussing the possibility of placing a joint bid for the 2030 FIFA World Cup.
Sanchez has already held talks with Morocco’s King Mohammed VI about the possibility.
The bid will involve Portugal as well. The first joint hosting of the World cup was in 2002 hosted by Japan and South Korea, for the first time in Asia.
The World Cup was also played for the first time on African soil when South Africa hosted the 2010 world cup.
A joint host by two continents will certainly be something FIFA officials would want to consider, giving there is always a controversy about biases in hosting.
The 2026 FIFA World Cup will also be jointly hosted by the United States, Canada, and Mexico.
Mexico will be the first country to host three men’s world cups.
The close proximity of Morocco, in Africa, to Spain and Portugal, in Europe, makes it seem easy for the countries to host the tournament jointly.
Teams will not have to travel long distances mid-tournament for matches.
“I made the proposal, firstly to the government then to King Mohammed VI to launch a shared application with Morocco, Portugal, Spain to host the 2030 World Cup,” said Sanchez after the meeting with the King in Rabat.
“It will be the first two-continent application, with Europe and Africa, and King Mohammed VI welcomed the proposal warmly,” Sanchez said.
The King has earlier ordered the Royal Moroccan Football Federation to bid on their own.
But the federation has not made any statement regarding the plans for a joint bid though.
