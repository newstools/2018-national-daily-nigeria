FC Ifeanyi Ubah and Enyimba International will receive $118,860 (N43,205,610) each from FIFA through the Nigeria Football Federation for featuring their players in the last World Cup.
The world football governing body has a profit-sharing deal with clubs whose players featured at the 2018 World Cup in Russia.
FIFA will share nearly £164million of their 2018 World Cup revenues with 416 clubs from 63 countries, nearly three times the amount it handed over after Brazil 2014 World Cup.
Clubs that provided players to World Cup teams will receive $8,500 for each day each player spent with their national side.
The two local clubs are entitled to half of the $237,720 paid through the NFF for the involvement of Ikechukwu Ezenwa at the 2018 FIFA World Cup with the Super Eagles of Nigeria.
Ezenwa, 28, featured for both FC Ifeanyi Ubah and Enyimba FC at different periods that covered the 2018 World Cup qualification and the final tournament in Russia proper.
He was however on the bench substitute in all of Nigeria’s three group E games as they exited from the tournament in the first round.
