Bayern Munich head coach Niko Kovac feels the strength of this year’s Bundesliga is part of the reason why his side are second in the table.
Bayern have won the title six years in a row and Kovac is relishing a battle with Dortmund over the second half of the campaign, which his side start at Hoffenheim on January 18.
“I feel we’re the Bayern from the start of the season again, that we’ve restored our ease and confidence – and that the lads are fired up to give it everything and put up a fierce fight against Borussia Dortmund,” Kovac told Bayern’s official website.
“It was a half year with many facets, very emotional, and certainly not boring. We had many good periods but also had to weather difficult ones. However, taken altogether we’re on a good track, and at the end of the day, our conclusion to the six months is positive.
“Unfortunately we had a little barren spell. The coaching staff thought about it a lot: the reasons why. Maybe we allowed ourselves to be influenced too much by what was suggested: that we’re unbeatable and that we’ll clinch the championship title again with a huge cushion.
“It creeps into your consciousness, and then everybody ends up lacking one or two per cent. In total that’s not enough. In my opinion, the Bundesliga is much more balanced and stronger than last year, which is why we had to fight. But the lads have recovered.
