Chief executive officer of the Nigeria National league NNL, Bukola Olopade during a chat  with National Daily recently gave reason why he resigned

I regrets the circumstances that led to this unfortunate situation in our football ,but insists that there is no going back on the resolution reached at the NNL congress in Abuja.

Olopade explained that at the meeting, the NNL took the decision not to go ahead with the Super 8 which could have paved way for the best four teams to get promoted to the NPFL, Instead, they have decided that all eight teams must get promoted under the present circumstances.

Olopade told National Daily that in supporting their position,  the congress of the NPFL did not consult them before arriving at the decision not to relegate any team, meaning they never recognized the fact that whatever decision they took, will have a direct bearing on the NNL.

Based on that, the NNL has decided to press the war button as they intend to go toe to toe with the LMC, organisers of the NPFL on this matter.

“We cannot be made to swallow their vomit, Olopade said. We have taken our decision and they must learn to live with it.

“At the last NFF meeting in Asaba, they asked that we go and take a decision in the best interest of the game and whatever decision we take, they will approve. We have done just that and we see no reason why anyone will want to go contrary.”

“If anything is done, different from the decision reach by the NNL congress in Abuja, I, Bukola Olopade will activate my earlier resignation from the position of chief executive officer, CEO of the NNL with immediate effect.”
