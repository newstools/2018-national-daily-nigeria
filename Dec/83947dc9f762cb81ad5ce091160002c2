The Brazilian has suggested he may be be keen to play in England in the future.
Neymar claimed every great player has to play in the Premier League at some stage as the Paris Saint-Germain superstar hinted at a move to England.
PSG forward Neymar has been linked with a switch to the Premier League in recent years – champions Manchester City and rivals Manchester United among the reported suitors.
Neymar signed a five-year contract when the Brazil sensation joined PSG from La Liga champions Barcelona in a world-record €222 million deal last year but the 26-year-old left the door open to a possible transfer to England.
“It’s a big competition. One of the greatest in the world,” Neymar replied in a video posted on YouTube after being asked by Manchester City full-back Benjamin Mendy if he would ever play in the Premier League.
“We don’t know how tomorrow will be, but I believe that every great player, at least one day, has to play in the Premier League.
“If you’re playing there, then I hope you can keep enjoying the Premier League because you deserve only the best. Hugs and thanks!”
Neymar has scored 11 Ligue 1 goals and 15 in all competitions for high-flying PSG this season.
