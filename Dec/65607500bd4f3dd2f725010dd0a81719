The UEFA Executive Committee has confirmed that VAR technology will be introduced into the Champions League this season.
The system will be implemented into the competition from the Round of 16 onwards, despite not being used throughout the group stages.
Back in September, UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin had confirmed the technology would be introduced for the 2019/20 campaign but pressure from clubs has brought this date forward.
“We are confident that introducing VAR in August 2019 will give us enough time to put in place a robust system,” Ceferin told UEFA media channels three months ago.
“It will afford us sufficient time to train match officials to ensure an efficient, successful implementation of VAR in the Champions League, the world’s flagship club competition.”
The technology has been introduced across a number of top European leagues including the Spanish top flight in 2018/19, while it was used in this summer’s World Cup.
