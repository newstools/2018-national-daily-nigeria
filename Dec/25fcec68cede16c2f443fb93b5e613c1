President Muhammadu Buhari is currently holding a meeting with Ogun state governor, Senator Ibikunle Amosun at the Presidential Villa, Abuja.
Amosun arrived the Villa around 12:30 pm and went straight to the President Buhari’s office for a closed door meeting.
The meeting is believed to be connected to the defection of Adekunle Akinlade, Amosun’s preferred candidate for Ogun state governorship election.
Adekunle Akinlade has since dumped the All Progressives Congress (APC) to the Allied People’s Movement (APM) with other loyalists of the governor.
