Manchester City have agreed to sign United States goalkeeper Zack Steffen, a deal his MLS club Columbus Crew described as a “historic transfer”.
National Daily learnt that the 23-year-old will join City in July 2019 on a four-year deal for about £7m and will stay with the Crew for the first part of the MLS season, which starts in March.
Steffen is the United States number one and has six international caps.
City described Steffen as “one of the outstanding talents in America”.
Crew said the transfer fee is the largest in their history and the most ever for an MLS goalkeeper in the league’s 23-year history.
