The new and vibrant president of the National Association of Nigeria Professional Footballers, NANPF, Tijani Babginda has began work earnest by immediately coming to the aid of a former footballer, Yusuf Mangut who is down with strokes in Jos with a donation of N100,000 to help in his medical expenses.


Tijani alongside his secretary general, Austin Popo and other of his personal aids stormed Jos on Thursday afternoon when he got the pathetic news of the former player health situation.


On arrival in Jos, the NANPF president and his team paid a courtesy call on Plateau state FA chairman from where they all proceeded to the Mangut’s home at Buguru. At the venue, Tijani met with Yusuf Mangut and his younger brother who is looking after him.


In his very short but precise speech, the NANPF president informed the Manguts that he could not wait a day longer when he heard of his situation expressing that the new association led by him will work towards responding to the needs of former and current players in distress.

Babaginda who also loves to be referred as the ‘Field General’ used the opportunity of the occasion to charge all former and current footballers in the state and the Nation at large to endeavor to register with the association stressing that only those who are under their registration henceforth will get their attention in any time of need.

After then, NANPF secretary general, Austin Popo on behalf of the association made donation of N100, 000 to Yusuf Mangut.

Yusuf Mangut was a well known player in Jos and Nigeria in the eighties and nineties. An attacking midfielder with the then JIB Rocks of Jos and was at one time or the other invited to the Super Eagles of Nigeria.
