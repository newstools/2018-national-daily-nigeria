Deontay Wilder retained his WBC heavyweight crown after battling to a split decision draw against Britainâ€™s Tyson Fury in a pulsating 12-round battle,National Daily learnt.
Wilder had Fury on the canvas twice, including a spectacular final round knockdown, but was unable to get the knockout victory he had promised to deliver at the Staples Center.
Fury was seemingly done as he lay motionless on the canvas in the 12th after a powerful right from Wilder caught him flush and the American followed it up with a devastating left hook.
But the Englishman somehow got to his feet and beat the count of referee Jack Reiss, and even looked to finish a tiring Wilder himself in the final round, catching him several times.
National Daily gathered that Fury celebrated wildly at the final bell, while Wilder also gestured that he believed he had won.
In the end it was announced there was a split decision before it was declared a draw. The three judges were divided on the outcome, with one scoring it 115-111 for Wilder, another 114-110 for Fury and the third 113-113.
