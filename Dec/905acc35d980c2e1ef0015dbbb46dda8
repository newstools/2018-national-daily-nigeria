Juventus superstar Cristiano Ronaldo has suggested that Lionel Messi “maybe needs more” after so long at Barcelona and has invited his eternal rival to join him in Serie A.
National Daily learnt that two talismanic performers who have cemented standings among the all-time greats spent nine years battling for supremacy in Spain prior to a stunning summer transfer window.
Ronaldo’s decision to leave Real Madrid for Turin in a €100 million (£90m/$114m) deal has left Messi as the standalone five-time Ballon d’Or winner in La Liga.
Ronaldo, though, would relish the opportunity to lock horns with Messi again in Italy if the opportunity presented itself.
“I played in England, Spain, Italy, Portugal, in the national team, while he is still in Spain. Maybe he needs me more.
“For me, life is a challenge, I like it and I like to make people happy.
“I would like him to come to Italy one day. Like me, accept the challenge.
“However, if he is happy there, I respect him.
“He is a fantastic player, a good guy but I do not miss anything here. This is my new life and I’m happy.”
