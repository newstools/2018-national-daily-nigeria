The Nigerian Air Force has debunked some reports concerning the unfortunate incident that led to the death of former Chief of Defense Staff (CDS), Air Chief Marshal Alex Badeh, on 18 December 2018.
Recall that Badeh, who served under ex-President Good luck Jonathan, was killed last Tuesday evening by unknown gunmen when his vehicle was attacked while returning from his farm along Abuja-Keffi Road.
In a press statement seen by National Daily, the Director of Public Relation & Information of NAF, Air Commodore Ibikunle Daramola, said while NAF appreciates the overwhelming show of support received from well-meaning Nigerians during this trying time, the Air Force wishes to request that the spreading of misinformation about the incident should stop forthwith as this could have adverse effects on the conduct of ongoing operations.
He said while some of the reports erroneously stated that the driver of the late former CDS, who was also shot during the incident, is dead, other reports alleged that adequate security was not provided for the deceased Air Chief Marshal.
According to him, nothing could be further from the truth as the late Air Chief Marshal Badeh was always provided with the full compliments of personal staff and security personnel commensurate with his status as a former Chief of the Air Staff (CAS), CDS and a 4-star general in the Armed Forces of Nigeria.
Commodore Daramola who disclosed that contrary to reports that the driver was shot dead, he is alive and recuperating extremely well at one of NAFâ€™s Hospitals.
He said NAF is working closely with other relevant security agencies to determine the circumstances surrounding the death of the former CDS with a view to ensuring that the perpetrators of the heinous act are brought to justice.
