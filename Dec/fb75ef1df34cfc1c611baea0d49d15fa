Super Eagles midfielder Mikel Agu is ready assert himself with his impressive display for Vitoria Setubal which snatched a late 1-0 win at Maritimo on weekend.
Fredrick Mendy scored the winner for the modest Portuguese team now moved up to seventh in the League table.
Since Agu’s arrival at the former club of late Nigerian striker Rashidi Yekini, the club has lost once and drawn another of six league games with Agu playing every single minute in all six matches.
Agu made his league debut in the 1-1 draw at Vitoria Guimares before following it up with two wins at home Moreirense (3-0) and away at Tondela (2-1).
The first and only loss for him (first in seven games for Setubal) came at Sporting Braga in a 2-1 reverse fixture.
“I had other options in Portugal and abroad, but when my manager told me about Vitoria’s interest, I did not think twice about it. I already knew the city and the club well and it was here that my son Stefano was born,” he said.
Setubal are now chasing a Europa League spot despite their modest status and also in the running for the Taca de Portugal where they are in the quarter-finals and due to face Sporting Braga on December 20.
Agu is on a year’s loan deal but if his form continues to hold, Setubal may be forced to break the bank and pay for his outright purchase from Porto.
