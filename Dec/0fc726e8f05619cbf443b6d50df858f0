The Washington Post, a major American daily newspaper published in Washington, has mocked President Muhammadu Buhari’s reply to an allegation by the self-acclaimed leader of the outlawed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, that he is an impostor.
The President had on Sunday in Krakow, Poland, during an interactive session with the Nigerian community in the country, denied the rumour that he is a clone.
Since Kanu resurfaced, he has been alleging that President Buhari is an imposter whose real name is Jibril Aminu Al-Sudani from Sudan and not a clone.
But Buhari, while speaking in Poland, where he is attending a climate change summit, said he would soon celebrate his 76th birthday, adding that “a lot of people hoped that I died during my ill health. Somebody just thought I am cloned, … it is real me I can assure you”.
In a satirical way, The Washington Post responded to the President’s response, saying: “Sounds like something a clone would say.”
