The Commissioner of Police, Lagos state command, Imohimi Edgal, says those behind the distorted picture of a police officer trending online are only being mischievous, and will be fish out for appropriate legal actions.

In a statement signed by the spokesman of the command, CSP Chike Oti, the command said attention of the CP has been drawn to the picture of a police officer bearing a banner on which was written “IS NOT OUR DUTY TO FIGHT BOKOHARAM, WE ARE NOT TRAINED TO” being circulated on the social media by mischief makers to discredit the Force.

He said having seen the picture, the command identified the picture as that of CSP(as he then was) Yusuf Ajape, former DPO, Ago Okota Police station, taken on November 4, 2017, during the launch of “Change Begins With Me” anti-corruption programme at the Police command headquarters, Ikeja.

“The Command finds it bewildering, what gain is there for those behind the removal of the original message which was “BAIL IS FREE”, replacing it with a message that is clearly aimed at demoralising our gallant policemen combating the insurgents in the North-eastern part of the country.”

He said based on the development, the CP has activated the ICT department of the Command to, in collaboration with relevant bodies, fish out the people behind the misinformation for appropriate legal actions.
