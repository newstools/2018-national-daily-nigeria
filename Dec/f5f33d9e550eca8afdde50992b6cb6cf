Two Boca Juniors fans killed a River Plate fan who celebrated the victory of his team in the return of the Copa Libertadores final, which took place at the Santiago Bernabéu in Madrid.
The 21-year-old Exequiel Aaron Neris was murdered in the province of Misiones when he returned from celebrating with friends the 3-1 victory against Boca River in Madrid.
According to the Clarín newspaper, the young man was assaulted by two Boca Juniors fans, who gave him a beating and gave him a fatal stab in his left leg, sectioning the femoral artery.
The young man was transferred seriously injured to the Favaloro Hospital in Villa Cabello, where he died hours later.
According to the family of the deceased, all supporters of Boca except Exequiel, the motivation for the attack in the Chacra 247 of Posadas was the River Plate shirt worn by the young man.
Exequiel’s mother, who was able to talk with her son in the hospital shortly before her death, confirmed that her son told her that “I’m dying, I’m dying, they attacked me for celebrating the game, because I’m a River fan.”
“They killed my son, he was just walking, he had surgery and he had three nails in one leg because he fell off the motorcycle a few months ago, they persecuted him even though he was hardly walking, and they hurt him like a defenseless dog”, said Lucia Ramona Neris, mother of Exequiel, in ‘First Edition, the Diario de Misiones’.
The Homicide Division of the Misiones Police, which found the knife that killed a latrine, has arrested two men, two brothers aged 18 and 22, fans of Boca Juniors, accused of the murder of Exequiel Aaron Neris.
