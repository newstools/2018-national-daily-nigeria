Lawrence Alobi, a retired commissioner of police, has called on the federal government to strengthen the country`s borders to check the influx of terrorists from neighbouring countries.

Alobi in  Abuja on Tuesday, December 11, said that the insurgents, who had been a threat to the well-being of Nigerians, gained access to the country through its porous borders.

He said: “It is believed that they navigate through the borders, the federal government should strengthen security at our borders to make sure they don’t have any access.”

National daily gathers that the former commissioner said that the insurgents did not come by air but by road, adding that if the whole area was condoned and bombarded, their number would be reduced.

He added: “The insurgents have declared war on Nigeria, it is no longer a joke, we should also declare total war on them.”

He said that every Nigerian had a duty under the section 24 of the 1999 constitution, as amended to defend the country and render national service as might be required.

He said: “Nigerians should say no to Boko Haram, insecurity and electoral violence as the 2019 general elections is fast approaching.

“It is only when the country is safe and secure that we can go about our lawful business.”

He said that the existing rivalry among security agencies in the country was a threat to security of the country.

Alobi noted that until this was done away with, no reasonable result would be achieved in the fight against insurgency in the country.

The former commissioner also called on the security agencies to put away pride, unite and fight the common enemy.
