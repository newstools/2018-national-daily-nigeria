The Speaker of the Lagos State House of Assembly and Chairman, Conference of Speakers of State Legislatures of Nigeria, Rt. Hon. Mudashiru Obasa has urged Nigerians, particularly Christians, to imbibe the spirit of love, tolerance, and sacrifice which made the life of Jesus Christ worthy of emulation.
Rt. Hon. Obasa, in his Christmas message released on Monday, stated that these are qualities essential for the development and growth of the country.
“Jesus Christ was an embodiment of peace, love, tolerance and sacrifice in his entire lifetime hence he is referred and adored throughout the world. For us to be great as a nation, we must not only imbibe these qualities but we must also put them into practice,” the Lagos Assembly Speaker said in the statement signed by his Chief Press Secretary, Musbau Rasak.
According to him, “throughout his life, Jesus Christ was tolerant even against his most bitter enemies, preached and shared love and peace and ended up sacrificing his life on the cross of Calvary which was the biggest supreme price one can pay for others to survive”.
Rt. Hon. Obasa reiterated the need for Nigerians to love one another, maintain peace, be tolerant of each other as ways of ensuring the continued existence of the country. “As we moved towards the 2019 general elections, we must remain united and refrain from actions and utterances that can lead to violence and chaos.
“Vigilance should be our watchword all the time hence we must be wary of any unusual action in our neighbourhood, so that we can continue to nib crime at the bud,” he said.
Rt. Hon. Obasa said, “on behalf of my colleagues in the Lagos State House of Assembly, I wish you all a happy Christmas celebration”.
