The Kogi State House of Assembly has declared vacant the seat of Linus Enenche, member representing Olamaboro Constituency, for his defection from the All Progressives Congress (APC), to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).
Bello Hassan Abdullahi, Majority Leader, moved the motion for the declaration of the seat of Enenche vacant for his defection from APC.
Abdullahi made reference to a letter transmitted to the House by the Kogi State APC Chairman, Abdul Bello, informing the House of Enencheâ€™s defection.
The State Chairman also said the letter that Enenche will be seeking re-election to the House on his new political party, the PDP, in 2019 General.
Abdullahi said that Enenche action contravened Section 109 -1 Sub Section G of the 1999 constitution as amended.
The motion was seconded by Ahmed Mohammed; but a PDP lawmaker in the House had raised objection to the motion on the basis that there was no evidence to back the motion and that Enenche has already dragged APC to court over the matter.
The Speaker Rt Hon Mathew Kolawole, overruled the PDP lawmaker and put the motion to vote.
Two of the three members present during the plenary voted YES while the only PDP member among them voted NO.
Enenche later told journalists that the action of his colleagues is reckless and unconstitutional. He complained that the Speaker of the House had refused to pay his salary and allowances for the past seven months.
