“De Gea stands peerless as the new No. 1 in our goalkeeping rank and, at 28, has all the hallmarks of a player approaching the peak of his powers,National Daily learnt.

His importance to a creaking Manchester United side is fundamental: He has rescued them repeatedly and, as of mid-November, has made 20 more saves than any other goalkeeper in the Premier League’s Big Six this season.”


Paul Pogba is ranked as the fourth-best central midfielder

“Where to begin? Pogba’s world-class talent isn’t in question, though his lack of consistency and application make him a lightning rod for critics.

In Russia, he scored in the final for France, playing with the kind of diligence that has largely eluded him at Manchester United. But there have been bright spots, such as inspiring his side to a comeback win against Man City in April with two goals.”
Romelu Lukaku is ranked as the sixth-best striker

“Lukaku splits punters down the middle. To one side, he is a marvel: a 25-year-old who will soon close in on 200 career goals. To the other, he doesn’t score enough when it matters most or have much feel for the game. But the bigger picture is that the Belgian, who scored four times in the World Cup, is a first-rate operator on the cusp of his peak years.”
