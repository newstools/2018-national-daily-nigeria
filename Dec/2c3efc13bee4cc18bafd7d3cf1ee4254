Jose Mourinho has said that Manchester United’s Maroune Fellaini “is not Maradona”, but feels the versatile Belgian is now getting the credit he deserves.

Fellaini scored the only goal of the match in midweek as the Red Devils struggled to overcome Swiss minnows Young Boys, proving his worth yet again for the Old Trafford side.

The midfielder has been under the microscope since arriving at United under David Moyes’ ill-fated spell as manager, but has scored important goals and played multiple key roles under his current boss.

“I think now he’s getting [the credit he deserves],” Mourinho said. “I think until I came [to Man Utd] he probably didn’t, but I think now everyone gives him what he deserves.

“Everybody knows Marouane is not Maradona but everyone knows what Marouane is and what he can give. In this moment, especially this season and also last season he did many times what strikers couldn’t do which is score goals in important moments.

“I know him very well and I know the positions he can play, the jobs he can do. This season you saw him as a third central defender against Burnley and you saw him as a striker and as a number eight, which is basically the position where Marouane has more balance and know how but he’s very important in both boxes, in the first third and in the last third.

“Now people know what Marouane is and he also feels that good feeling.”
