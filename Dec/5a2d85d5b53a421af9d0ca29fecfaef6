The Brazilian led the French side past the Anfield outfit but says he was not at his best for Wednesday’s Champions League clash.
Paris Saint-Germain star Neymar said he was still struggling with his adductor injury despite leading his team past Liverpool in the Champions League.
Neymar had been in doubt for Wednesday’s clash after suffering an injury while on international duty with Brazil earlier this month.
But the forward was on hand as his side topped Liverpool, pouncing on a rebound from an Edinson Cavani shot and putting it home as PSG claimed a 2-1 win to move into second in Group C.
“I was not 100 per cent,” Neymar told reporters, via L’Equipe .
“But it was an important match so, injured or not, I had to be there.”
Neymar’s goal was not only a winner, it saw him become the all-time leading Brazilian goalscorer in Champions League history.
He moved past former AC Milan and Real Madrid star Kaka, who netted 30 Champions League goals, with his 31st striker in the European competition.
Sitting in third place is Brazilian legend Rivaldo, who scored 27 during stints with Barcelona and AC Milan.
Neymar has also now been directly involved in 50 goals in the Champions League, adding 19 assists to his 31 strikes.
The win leaves PSG in decent shape in Group C, though three teams in the group still have a chance to make it to the knockout rounds.
PSG (eight points) are second to Napoli (nine) in Group C after their win over Liverpool (six) but can clinch a spot in the last-16 with a win over Red Star on the final matchday.
Anything short of that could leave the French giants on the outside looking in, with Liverpool and Napoli set for a crunch clash in their group finale.
PSG return to Ligue 1 action to face off against Bordeaux on Sunday, with the club looking to extend an already sizeable 15-point lead atop the table.
