The National Association of Enterprise Employers (NAEE) organizers of the National Entrepreneurship Empowerment Programme (NEEP) in Nigeria, has accused the Central Bank of Nigeria of frustrating its effort to access a N2bn grant for its over 4 million members through the Anchor Borrower scheme.
In a petition dated November 13, 2018 to President Muhamadu Buhari with a copy made available to National Daily and signed by both the National President/DG, Dr. Ukai Solomon Akpan and National Secretary, Sir T.C Koko, NAEE said it has applied for the grants in the last three years for the over 4 million young and old business entrepreneurs without success.
“Since the CBN is making life difficult for the young and old Business Entrepreneurs by not allowing Entrepreneurs to access the numerous Empowerment Grants, to help us improve productions so as to reduce the prices of goods and commodities in the country, hence the warning strike/Peaceful Demonstration.”
The group also alleged that following repeated failure by the CBN to release the fund, it will not be out of place to describe the Anchor Borrowers scheme as a scam that  has not in any way help young entrepreneurs as being claimed.
“Consequently therefore, we have come to the conclusion that all buying and selling of goods and commodities will be at stand still for two weeks until the CBN gives us the reason why  they are not responding  to any of our application letters sent to them by our Association or even  give directives to where or whom we can approach for positive actions , which can be of help in the area of employment and job creations, that will  drastically reduce unemployment and youth restiveness in this era of uncommon war against corruption of the present administration,  Which will also help to put a stop to unnecessary unionism which is capable of hindering the economy and peaceful co-existence of Entrepreneurs than holding our dear nation to ransom.”
The group therefore pleaded with President Muhammadu Buhari to intervene by directing the CBN governor to dialogue with them on how to resolve the impasse. “We hope our proposal will be duly looked into, as we strive to keep a good entrepreneurial relationship with the Federal Government of Nigeria.”
