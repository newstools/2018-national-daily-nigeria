The disgraced former lecturer at the Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Pro. Richard Akindele, who was accused of demanding sex from a student, Monica Osagie, to give her better mark, on Monday admitted in court that he is guilty of the offence.

Recall that earlier in the year, a student undergoing the Masters of Business programme, Miss Monica Osagie, had released a recorded telephone conversation, which went viral, in which the lecturer, identified as Akindele, demanded five rounds of sex to enhance Monica’s marks.

He was subsequently sacked after a panel set up by the school to investigate the matter came out with the verdict that he had inappropriate relationship with his student.

Prof. akindele, according to the panel, was said to have acted in a manner that compromised his position as a teacher and examiner, in that his conversations with Monica Osagie were about examination scores and inducement of favour for the alteration of examination scores.

Akindele who was dragged to court had earlier pleaded not guilty to the charge levelled against him.

At the resumption of hearing of the case on Monday, Akindele changed his plea from ‘not guilty’ to ‘guilty.’

The prosecutor, Shogunle Adenekan, said all parties in the matter had reached an agreement and pleaded for a suspended sentence for the accused.
