Samuel Umtiti remains at the Aspetar clinic in Doha with the specific treatment for the cartilage injury in his left knee and both he and Barça have been given until next week to decide whether or not to go through the operating room.
Based on this, and with the market lifting the blind, it will be the club’s turn to define if it decides to go to the winter window to reinforce the backbone and in this case another decision to be taken by the technical secretariat is if you bet on a young central or one with more experience.
It should be remembered that the young De Ligt is one of the names in which Barça has his eyes on but Marc Overmars, coach of Ajax, already assured repeatedly that he will not leave this January.
