President Muhammadu Buhari, while addressing the joint session listed the achievements of his administration, was interrupted intermittently by protesting lawmakers.

As he mentioned each achievement, they chorused, ‘No!’ The development forced the All Progressives Congress lawmakers to clash as the opposition lawmakers booed the President.

When he said, “We have weathered the storms and made progress on every front,” They screamed, “Nooooo! Boooo!”

When he said, “The economy has recovered well,‎” the lawmakers screamed again.

Buhari who was displeased with the development was forced to say, “The world is watching us and we are supposed to be above this.”

The protesters however continued, particularly when Buhari said his administration had made success in its anti-corruption campaign.
