Qatar’s Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy (SC) has revealed the renderings for Lusail Stadium – one of the many multipurpose venues that will host the 2022 FIFA World Cup games.
Designed by London-based architecture firm Foster + Partners, the 80,000-seat arena – the eighth World Cup structure to be unveiled by the SC – features a number of visual motifs derived from the Arabian Gulf’s ancient artisanal cultures.
The stadium’s shape, for example, is intended to reflect the stylistics of traditional Qatari lanterns and earthenware.
In a speech made at the unveiling of the design, FIFA Secretary General Fatma Samoura remarked: “I particularly enjoy the fact that Middle Eastern culture is reflected in Lusail’s and several other designs, and I look forward to seeing football fans from all over the world discover the culture and history of the region.”
Similarly, SC Secretary General H.E. Hassan Al Thawadi praised Lusail as a “showpiece stadium” and expressed his hope that “future generations” would look to it as a “source of inspiration, perseverance, and innovation”.
The new facility, which is being built by HBK Contracting Company and China Railway Construction Corporation, is set to become one of the most prominent structures in the long-anticipated Lusail City, a futuristic commercial and leisure development expected to be completed in 2030.
Following the World Cup, the arena will be transformed into a community hub with “schools, shops, cafés, sports facilities, and health clinics”.
