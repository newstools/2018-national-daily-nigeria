Yaya Toure has reportedly left Olympiakos after just three months and five matches.
The Ivorian joined Olympiakos in September following his Manchester City exit in the summer.
Toure hasn’t played a game since the start of November and has made only three starts for the Greek club.
According to radio station Sport24, Toure has fallen well short of what was expected of him and bid farewell to his teammates after training on Tuesday.
The 35-year-old had a number of offers in the summer, including some from the Premier League, but opted to join Olympiakos.
Toure has been substituted in each of his three starts and was hooked at half time in the shock defeat to OFI Crete.
Toure won three Premier League titles during his time at City after arriving from Barcelona in 2010.
He became a real fans favourite during his eight years at the Etihad but fell out of favour under Pep Guardiola.
Olympiakos haven’t made an announcement on Toure’s future but he could join a new club in January.
