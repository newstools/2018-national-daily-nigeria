Following the inability of the APC national leadership to resolve the party’s crisis in Imo, Uche Nwosu, former Chief of Staff to the governor and guber aspirant has dumped the ruling part for the Action Alliance.
Nwosu disclosed this on Tuesday, at the Sam Mbakwe International Cargo Airport, Owerri, shortly after his arrival from Abuja. He reportedly said ”the APC forced him out”.
He also claimed the entire party structure has been shifted to the new party where he hopes to get the ticket.
According to him, injustice, impunity, and lack of respect for party’s constitution forced him out of the All Progressives Congress.
Gov Rochas Okorocha has been fighting to succeed himself with his CoS and son-in-law, and the move has divided the party in two, particularly against the party’s national chairman, Adams Oshiomhole.
Nwosu lost the party’s governorship ticket to a Senator, Hope Uzodinma.
His godfather Okorocha is still in the party, and has said he’s not defecting.
Nwosu e also said he has no problems with President Muhammadu Buhari and will support his re-election bid.


“We are going to work with APC to deliver Imo State to President Muhammadu Buhari. We will deliver Governor Rochas Okorocha as senator because Action Alliance has no senatorial candidate in Orlu zone.
