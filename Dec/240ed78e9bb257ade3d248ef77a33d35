UEFA announced that the representative of the Premier League, Mathieu Moreil, will replace Javier Tebas, president of LaLiga, in the Strategic Committee of the organization. The Englishman will be in charge until the end of next season. The Strategic Commission is the one that deals with the relationship with the clubs of the ECA and intervenes in matters such as calendar and laws of signing.
Javier Tebas resigned last September as a member of the UEFA Strategic Committee after a tense conversation with his president, Ceferin, who did not like the clash between Tebas and the president of PSG. As Sique Rodríguez revealed in the program ‘Què t’hi jugues’ of Ser Catalunya, at the PSFC meeting in August in Monaco, Javier Tebas had a heated discussion with Nasser Al-Khelaifi, calling him a “cheat” in the presence of several witnesses. . They say that the tone used by Thebes was very hard, losing the papers on occasion, something that did not like the rest of the members of the commission. Al-Khelaifi replied that if he had no evidence to bring him before a judge, he would be silent.
