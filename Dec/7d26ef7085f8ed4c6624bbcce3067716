Liverpool left-back Alberto Moreno has spoken out against manager Jurgen Klopp after being dropped for Andy Robertson.
Moreno started last season as first-choice left-back despite midfielder James Milner having been preferred the season before and the signing of Robertson from Hull City.
However, an injury to the Spaniard opened the door for his Scottish counterpart and he excelled and is now an undisputed starter on the left of a dramatically improved defence that has shipped just seven goals in 19 Premier League games.
“I didn’t feel [the decision to stick with Robertson] well, I was injured giving my best for our team,” Moreno said. “I disliked Klopp’s decision because I was training but when I returned he only wanted Robertson. My relationship with Klopp hasn’t changed but since this injury, I didn’t have a meeting with him but our relationship is normal. I disliked the way that Klopp has treated me but I understand his situation that he can’t change [Robertson] because the team is winning.”
Despite his complaints, he insists that the atmosphere amongst the Reds squad is very good.
“The dressing room is very close, we are a family,” he added.
