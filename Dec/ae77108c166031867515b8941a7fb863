Barcelona have matched Bayern Munich’s record run of unbeaten home matches in Champions League competition, with a draw against Tottenham taking them to 29.
Within Barca’s record-matching run, they have won 26 games and been held on three occasions.
They now stand alongside Bayern at the top of that particular chart, with the Bundesliga outfit having completed a 29-match run of their own at the Olympiastadion in April 2002.
Ernesto Valverde’s side will have the opportunity to set a new benchmark when they take to the field in the last 16.
