The Abia state police command has declared war on kidnappers and cultists as a means of ensuring the state is crime free during the festive season.

The state commissioner of police, Chris Ezike, told journalists that the command had set up anti- kidnapping squad in all police divisions in the state for the purpose of checking the spread of cultism.

He complained that cultism had infiltrated several parts of the state including secondary schools, markets and streets. Ezike said that an anti-cultism outfit that will combine carrot and stick will soon take off before Christmas.

The commissioner urged residents to volunteer information about criminals to the security agencies to ensure a crime free holiday season.

“On the challenges of kidnapping in Aba area of Abia State and the need to coordinate and consolidate our efforts as well as promote the use of technology in tackling the menace, I have with immediate effect established the Abia State Command Anti-Kidnapping Squad with jurisdiction to cover all parts of the State, the commissioner said.

“A superintendent of Police has also been appointed as the squad leader and in the coming days, their impact will be felt in mitigating the challenges of kidnapping. Cultism in Abia State may assume a worrisome dimension if drastic measures are not put in place to checkmate the activities of these sons and daughters of evil.
