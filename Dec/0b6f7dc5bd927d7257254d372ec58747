Abuja- Edo state has secured first medal in the ongoing 19th National sports festival as Loveth Aboki picked silver medal in the 45 kg of para power lifting event .
National Daily learnt that Loveth came second closely behind Rivers state’s Rukayat Ajiboye who won the Gold medal for her state after both of them had tied on 107 kg but beat the Edo girl on body weight difference of 43.5 against 43.0.
The result automatically qualified both finalists for the All African Games coming up next year.
National Daily gathered that the Edo lifter who thanked God for the opportunity to represent Edo state ,attributed the drop in her performance to fatigue, explaining that the long night journey from Edo between Wednesday night to Thursday morning really affected her and others in no small measure.
” I thank God for the opportunity to represent Edo and for crowning my work with success but 107 is below my best.
My best in training is 115kg,so,losing 110 is the effect of the stress we went through while coming yesterday.”She emphasized.
Chinoso Onyebueke came third to get Bronze for Abia state.
