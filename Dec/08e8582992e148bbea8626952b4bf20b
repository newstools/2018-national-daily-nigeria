Ajax captain Daley Blind revealed on Monday that there were cries of joy and euphoria among his teammates after they learned they had drawn Real Madrid in the Champions League.

There was banging on tables and much excitement at Ajax’s training ground as the players gathered indoors to watch the draw unfold on television.

Blind insisted that the excitement came from being aware of Real’s recent struggle for form, having been beaten 3-0 by CSKA Moscow last week.

“They are a fantastic team but we have to trust ourselves,” he told De Telegraph after revealing the training ground excitement.

“We must believe we can do it because we will have a period of rest and enough time to improve,” the Dutchman told NOS.

“If we look at recent games, we’ve been able to compete with a top level team like Bayern Munich, both at home and away.

“If we show the same energy, bravery and courage then we will have chances but we have be realistic.

“Madrid are the holders and have won the last three Champions League so it will certainly not be easy.

“But we want to move onto the next round and nothing is impossible.”

Ajax came second in Group E of the Champions League after a thrilling 3-3 draw at home to Bayern Munich in their final group stage game.
