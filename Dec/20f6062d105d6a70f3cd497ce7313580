Cristiano Ronaldo had laid down the gauntlet to Barcelona forward Lionel Messi, insisting he should take on the challenge of playing in Italy.
Messi has spent his entire career with Barcelona and Ronaldo, who has played for Sporting CP, Manchester United, Real Madrid and now Juventus, feels that while Messi may not miss him in LaLiga, he would like him to come to Serie A in the future.
“No [he Messi doesn’t miss me], maybe I miss him a little,” Cristiano Ronaldo told La Gazzetta dello Sport. “I have played in England, Spain, Italy, Portugal, with the national team, while he has stayed in Spain.
“Maybe, he needs me more. For me, life is a challenge, I like it and I like to make it happy. I would like him to come to Italy one day. Do what I did, accept the challenge. However, if he is happy there, I respect that.
“He is a great player, a great guy, but here I don’t miss anything. This is my new life and I am happy.
