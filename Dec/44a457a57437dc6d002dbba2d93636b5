Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho offered a somewhat bizarre response when questioned about Liverpool’s recent spending ahead of the two sides’ meeting on Sunday.
National Daily learnt that the north west rivals face off at Anfield with the home side heading into the Premier League weekend sitting atop the table after an unbeaten 16-match run of domestic fixtures.
Their form has been built off the back of some impressive signings over the last 12 months, but Mourinho believes their performances are not solely down to flashing the cash.
He did, however, go about explaining his apparent acclaim of Jurgen Klopp’s coaching in a way in which only Mourinho can.
“It’s not just about the money they spend in the summer, is about many things,” he told a press conference.
“It’s not just about spending money and reinforcing the squad, a football team is more than that, is not just about spending the money.
“It’s like a house, it’s not just about buying the furniture, you have to do work, you spend money on the best possible furniture and then you’re ready to live in an amazing house.”
