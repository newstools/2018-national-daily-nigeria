But battles for his gov candidate’s victory in APM




Governor Ibikunle Amosun of Ogun State at the All Progressives Congress (APC) stakeholders meeting in Abeokuta on Monday insisted that he will not quit the ruling APC on which platform he will contest the 2019 senatorial election in the state.
National Daily gathered that the APC meeting was attended by Adekunle Akinlade, Allied People’s Movement (APM) governorship candidate in Ogun State anointed by Amosun.
The Ogun Governor stated that the aggrieved APC members who defected to the Allied People’s Movement (APM) have his blessings. The ruling APC lost 26 aggrieved candidates loyal to Amosun, who defected to the APM. Amosun further insisted that he will give maximum support to the APM governorship candidate, Akinlade, in the 2019 governorship election in the state.
“When these people came, they told me they are leaving the APC, I said ‘no’ but I couldn’t stop them. In fact, Akinlade has my full support.
“I am not going to stop him, everything I have, I will use to support him, let them try whatever they want to try, we also have our strategies and I am not going to hide behind one finger.
“I remain in APC because that’s what those people want, they want us to leave APC but they are joking.
“I will stay in APC to ensure that Buhari wins in Ogun State and to let them know that they can’t subvert the will of the state.
“Every day, I will campaign for President Muhammdu Buhari, we will do everything possible to ensure Buhari wins massively in Ogun, but they should not miss it. I, Sen. Ibikunle Amosun, will not support anyone they are bringing,” Amosun declared.
