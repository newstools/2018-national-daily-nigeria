The Nigeria Customs Service (NCS), Zone A, Lagos, on Tuesday, December 11, said it seized goods valued at N2.7 billion smuggled through the Lagos border over the past four weeks.

This was disclosed to newsmen by the unit’s boss, Abubakar Mohammed, who also said 3,792 kilograms of Indian hemp smuggled from Ghana was seized.

It was gathered that he said the N379, 200, worth of drugs were intercepted along the Ogun and Oyo states axis, adding that two suspects were arrested and detained.

He said: “This is the third time I am having this press conference with you since I was posted here four months ago. This seizure is a special one because we are going to the end of the year. Before the end of the year, I have a gift for Nigerians.

“For the first time, since the history of Federal Operations Unit, Zone A, we have a big seizure of dangerous drugs, (which) is why I said I have a gift for Nigerians.

“The customs service is not just for revenue generation but to defend the course of the nation. Just imagine the danger this may pose to those (who would have taken) them. We are going to destroy them, so they will (not find their) way back to the society.”

The seized goods included among others 39,664 bags of 50 kilogrammes rice worth N525, 639,228; 710 cartons of tramadol valued at N808, 000, 000; and 34 vehicles of different types with 784,411,452 as its value.
