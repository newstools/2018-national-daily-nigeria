The maximum shareholder of Real Valladolid, Ronaldo Nazario, was protagonist along with Carlos Suárez, president of Real Valladolid, of Europa Press breakfasts. The Brazilian acknowledged that he is in contact with Gerard Piqué and that they have a pending meeting to “talk about business”. “My nieces are in love with Shakira. One day I sent him a message asking for a video and he sent it to me. Then we started talking. I know that he has an important group with investments in sports (Kosmos) and we have agreed to meet to talk about our projects, but we have not done it yet. It is good that sportsmen direct in sports. Here we go one hundred per hour with a lot of work, but obviously at some point we will cross over and talk about business, “said Ronaldo.
The Brazilian also spoke about former president Josep Lluis Núñez, recently deceased and the man who signed Ronaldo for Barça. “He had an incredible contribution to Barça and I had an excellent year with him. Little came to the club, but was present in our requests. Unfortunately my final with Barcelona everyone knows, it was quite turbulent, and I did not end the story well in the club, but we all appreciate your contribution to football and especially to Barcelona, “said Ronaldo.
