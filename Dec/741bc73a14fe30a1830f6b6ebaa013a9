Rodrigo Bentancur and Giorgio Chiellini were unlikely goalscorers with Cristiano Ronaldo also on target as Juventus won 3-0 at Fiorentina to move 11 points clear at the top of Serie A.
National Daily learnt that Juve were far from their brilliant best in Florence on Saturday but Bentancur’s first-half strike set up a fifth straight league win for the defending champions that stretches their lead over Napoli.
Federico Chiesa was guilty of wasting Fiorentina’s best opportunities, but Chiellini made no mistake when he was presented with a chance, the defender’s header looping in despite Alban Lafont’s best efforts.
After Ronaldo converted a late penalty, Juventus collected three points from a trip to Florence that saw vice-president Pavel Nedved condemn graffiti referring to the Heysel disaster outside the Stadio Artemio Franchi.
