The governorship candidate of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Lagos state, Jimi Agbaje, says the issue he had with the National leader of the All Progressives congress is one of a difference in values and principles, and nothing personal.

According to the PDP guber candidate, he parted ways with Tinubu over the diffence on democratic values, stressing that the idea of one man controlling a state like Lagos is unacceptable.

“I have no personal rift with him (Tinubu). What exists between us is all about differences in value and principle. When we were together, I discovered that his own idea of democracy was not what I was taught, so I had to take an exit.

“I am saying that what we are running today in Lagos is a one-man Lagos. A Lagos where somebody says when he is going to bed, Lagos is going to bed, to me that can no longer be tolerable. Lagos must be made to work for the people of Lagos,” he added.

Agbaje also alleged that the Lagos state government has refused to be transparent in the way it spends the people’s money.

According to him, “It is unfortunate that Lagos State under the control of the APC has refused to domesticate the Freedom of Information Act. Everything in government in Lagos State is shrouded in secrecy. The time has come to hand the fortune of the state over to the people.

“Seven trillion naira is what the state government has spent in the last 20 years, and what have we got to show for it? If you look at the average for education in Lagos, only 20 per cent of our children have passed WAEC in five years. The question is, are we getting value? The answer is, we are not getting value at all.”

Jimi Agbaje, who was a member of the Action Congress, before he defected to the Democratic People’s Alliance and then to the Peoples’ Democratic Party,  is running for the number one job in Lagos state for the third time, and his major contender, is Tinubu’s anointed candidate, Babajide Sanwo-Olu.
