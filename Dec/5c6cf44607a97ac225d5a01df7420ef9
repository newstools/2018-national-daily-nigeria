According to the member, it has become necessary for me to add my voice to the call of many Nigerians on the purported campaigns of calumny by some political gladiators and media houses against the office and person of the Vice President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Professor Yemi Osinbajo on spurious allegations of corrupt practices level against him.
“The issues raised in the probe on NEMA had to do with misappropriation of funds by the Director-General and the day to day running of the agency vis-a-vis financial spendings, procurement processes among others”, he said.
While reminding his colleagues of their constitutional duties, the Edo born lawmaker urged them to shealth their swords.
He advised them not to heat the polity as elections draw nearer.
He added that “We must shun tendencies and actions that divide us, our campaign and actions must be driven by issues and policies and not by Prebendal politics.”
“We are more united as a people with love and service to humanity than tribe and planting seeds of discord.”
