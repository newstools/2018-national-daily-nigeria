Gianluigi Buffon admits the end of his Juventus career was ‘stressful’ and claims ‘others could’ve left’ without Cristiano Ronaldo.
Buffon brought his 17-year association with Juve to an end over the summer, joining Paris Saint-Germain on a free transfer, and the veteran goalkeeper suggested incidents such as lashing out at referee Michael Oliver took their toll on him.
“I think, speaking in a friendly way with the President after such a long and stressful period because being a Juventus player and captain weighs on you a little, even if it’s an honour, the time had come for us to go our separate ways,” he told Tiki Taka.
“I considered retiring or carrying on playing if an incredible offer from a top club came my way. If it had come from an exotic League, I wouldn’t have considered it.
“The offer from PSG arrived in May, and it made me consider the option of playing for another year or two.
“It was an unnatural choice but one I thought about a lot. We left each other on sweet terms, that’s what I wanted and I think everyone else did too.
“I won seven Scudetti in a row and even if you’re stronger, you never take winning for granted. It involves so much nervous fatigue.
“For me it was time to say ‘enough’. Juve probably felt others could’ve left and that the only way to reawaken everyone was buying Cristiano.”
