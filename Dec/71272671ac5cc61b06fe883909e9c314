Luka Modric, brand new Golden Ball 2018, will bag for having won this award the not insignificant figure of 800,000 euros. The origin of this figure is not in the prize he received this Tuesday in Paris but in the contract signed by the captain of the Croatia national team and Real Madrid player with Nike, his main sponsor.
According to elconfidencial.com, that contract includes a clause whereby the ’10’ merengue will receive 800,000 euros if it wins the Golden Ball. An amount that, according to the iaforementioned source, the US multinational has already begun to amortize with the sale of Modric products, which after the success of Croatia in the World Cup in Russia, which was proclaimed runner-up, and after the Golden Ball, has risen as the foam.
