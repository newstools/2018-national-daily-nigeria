Ahead of 2019 gubernatorial election Ogun state, Abdul Kabir Adekunle Akinlade, candidate of the Allied People’s Movement (APM), has boasted that he would emerge the next governor of the state come 2019.

He boasted that the APM would defeat the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in the governorship contest and other elective positions in 2019 in the state.

According him, he would sustain the principle and tempo of rebuilding mission of the incumbent Governor Ibikunle Amosun, if elected as governor.

Akinlade who disclosed this while addressing newsmen and APM supporters, on Monday, December 17, blasted the ruling All Progressives Congress, blaming the party for on the platform of another party.

“In a brazen falsification of the will of the people of Ogun State and the open disregard for internal democracy, the Adams Oshiomhole-led National Working Committee (NWC) came out with the predetermined results awarding victory to their adopted aspirants in various elective offices.

“All genuine efforts by various stakeholders across the nation to make them see reason and accept the people’s choice have fallen in deaf ears. The same brazen disregard for decency and best practices was displayed in many state chapters of APC across the country.

“The imposition of candidates and the open hostility to the duly elected party leadership in the state have therefore compelled us to look for an alternative platform in search of justice, internal democracy and sustenance of the mission to rebuild Ogun State. The larger interest of Ogun state must therefore not be sacrificed at the altar of a self-seeking minority.” Akinlade stated.
