Demands N30m ransom




Gunmen at the weekend kidnapped the Financial Secretary of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ekiti State, Mr. Kayode Oni.
Oni was said to be abducted on the Efon Alaaye-Erio-Ekiti federal highway when returning to his home, Aramoko Ekiti, headquarters of Ekiti West Local Government area late on Saturday.
The PDP State Publicity Secretary, Mr. Jackson Adebayo, was gathered to have confirmed the kidnap, saying that Oni went to conduct the PDP local government congress and was abducted while returning home.
Adebayo said the kidnappers had already established contact with Oni’s wife and younger brother and had demanded N30 million as ransom.
Oni was said to be in the vehicle with his daughter and grandson.
Adebayo narrated: “He went to conduct our Local Government Congress in Efon Alaaye and he was abducted while returning to Aramoko.
“The family had been contacted, but they told the abductors that even the entire family can’t raise N1 million and they were requesting for a staggering sum of N30 million to secure his freedom.
“The family told us reliably that it had made a formal complaint at the police station in Efon about the situation and they promised to take action.
“Our party is not resting as well. We are making contacts to ensure that his safety is guaranteed in the kidnappers’ den.’’
