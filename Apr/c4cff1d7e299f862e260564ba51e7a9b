Following the heightened rates of killing in Benue in the last two weeks, the Defence Headquarters, Abuja, has come out with yet another theory–that the latest herdsmen violence is sponsored.
And the military authorities, says Director, Defence Information, Brig. Gen. John Agim, will soon apprehend the killer herders and their backers.
“The military is strategising on how to go after the herdsmen and their sponsors,” he said.
“We will get both the herdsmen and their sponsors.”
According to him, the military will not support any side in the violence.
The renewed violence has taken no fewer than 40 lives, including those of a soldier, two Cathoilic priests, and worshipers, in the last few days.
On Wednesday, 22 people were killed when herdsmen attacked Daudu, in the Guma area of the state.
And on Thursday, herdsmen invaded Africa Church in Mbamondo clan of Ukemberagya Gaambe-Tiev, in the Logo Local Government Area, killing seven internally displaced persons.
But the Defence spokesperson said the Nigerian military is fine-tuning its operations, and Nigerians will soon feel the impact.
He added the military had been recovering guns and other weapons from herdsmen and locals in several areas of Benue and Taraba states.
