Also reacting, one of Atiku’s support group, Atiku Solidariy Movement said the alleged statement credited to Atiku was an unprovoked attack on the Atiku Abubakar brand.
“We are aware he is the main threat to most politicians in Nigeria today but H.E Atiku Abubakar will never result to gutter politics no matter the provocation,” had said on Friday night.
Another support group, Atiku_nation Icg said the tweet was the hand work of detractors trying to tarnish the image of Atiku. “Detractors will always device means to discredit sellable candidate like Atiku.”
Meanwhile President Muhammadu Buhari has continued to be under fire from lawmakers in the National Assembly over the payment of $496m for purchase of Tucano jets without their approval.
