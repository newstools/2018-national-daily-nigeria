A brother of Sen. Dino Melaye and three others have been clasped behind bars in Kuje by a Chief Magistrate’s Court in Mpape, Abuja.
The court remanded Samuel Melaye along with Amaefula David, Pius Inyang and Mohammed Wazari on Wednesday, and they are to remain in custody till April 30 when the ruling on their bail application would be delivered.
Their detention came after the First Information Report the police filed against the four men on Wednesday.
The report linked the four defendants to the Tuesday’s incident at Area One, Roundabout Abuja, where Melaye was said to have jumped out from a police vehicle conveying him to face other charges in Lokoja, Kogi State.
The police charged them with criminal conspiracy, obstruction of public servant from performing his lawful duties, abatement and assault on police officers, offences which were said to be contrary to sections 97, 85, 267 and 173 of the Penal Code Law.
The four defendants pleaded not guilty to the charges when read to them on Wednesday.
Their lawyer, Mr. Nkem Okoro, of the law firm of Chief Mike Ozekhome (SAN), orally applied for their bail.
But the bail application was opposed by the police.
The presiding magistrate then adjourned until Monday to deliver a ruling on the application.
