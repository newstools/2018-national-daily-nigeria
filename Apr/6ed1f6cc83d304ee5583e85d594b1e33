Former special adviser to the President on Niger Delta and coordinator, Presidential Amnesty Programme, Brig-Gen Paul Boroh (rtd) has attributed his unceremonious sack by President Muhammadu Buhari to those he called corrupt elements in the presidency.

He said not everyone was happy about his modest achievements in office, noting that he was asked by the ‘corrupt elements’ to share ‘the spoils of his office’ among them.

In a chat with journalist at the weekend, Boroh despite his sack from the Amnesty Office said he had no regrets working in Buhari’s administration, noting that his impact was felt in the Niger Delta.

“When one is heading an intervention programme like the Presidential Amnesty Programme, you meet with the good, bad, and ugly. Not everyone was happy about my modest achievements in office.

“A few days before I left office I was always re-echoing it that the Presidential Amnesty Programme was not a political programme where you share money out to people.

“You know the president’s stance on corruption, and this did not go down well with so many people who felt they were entitled to resources meant for the rehabilitation of ex-agitators.

“So those protesters you saw were the brainchild of our detractors. “I was appointed to deliver, and that was what I did during my time as coordinator of PAP,” he said.

It would be recalled that the Ministry of Niger Delta Affairs disbursed a total of N45 million to about 90 youths and women in the region who have successfully undergone its training programme to enable them to start their own trading.

The release of the funds to the beneficiaries was part of the ministry’s commitment towards reducing unemployment and youth restiveness in the region.
