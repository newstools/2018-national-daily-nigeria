Chinese Super League side Shanghai Shenhua has confirmed that their injured striker Obafemi Martins will travel to England to   undergo surgery.

“Martins is flying to UK for surgery today. Be well soon,” the club wrote on their Twitter handle.

The 33-year-old is set to spend about seven months on the sidelines after suffering a  hamstring injury in his right knee in Tuesday’s Asian Champions League encounter against Kashima Antlers.

Martins, who played for  Newcastle United and Birmingham City in England,  was replaced after his injury. Shenhua were dumped out of the  tournament after a 2-2 stalemate at Hongkou Stadium.

 The former  Seattle Sounders attacker  has scored  three league  goals for Shenhua, who are placed sixth in the Chinese Super League.
