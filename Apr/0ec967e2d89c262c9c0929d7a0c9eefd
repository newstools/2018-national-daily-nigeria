The presidency has responded to the outburst of former President Olusegun Obasanjo, saying there is nothing new in recent attack on President Muhammadu Buhari and his administration.

Obasanjo had railed on the APC government, describing Buhari as a failure which Nigerians must vote out in 2019.

But Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity Femi Adesina said Buhari would not engage Obasanjo, his senior in the military.

“President Buhari was made a minister under him during the military regime. So, President Buhari will never take issue with him,” said Adesina.

He then added that since Obasanjo did not say anything different from what was contained in a letter he released on the administration in February, the response provided by the Federal Government then was still relevant.

“So, the response the minister gave to that letter suffices to whatever President Obasanjo has just said.”

The former president has launched a sustain campaign against the candidate he endorsed to lead Nigeria in 2015, saying Nigeria needs a third force to free itself from the two major parties he recently described as leprous.
