Pope Francis has decried an attack on a church in Nigeria during which two priests and other worshippers were killed.
Associated Press reports that the pontiff spoke on Nigeria during his remarks to the public in St. Peter’s Square.
“The pontiff prayed that Nigeria’s Christian community find harmony and peace,” AP reported.
The pope’s comments came just as a large number of Christians in Nigeria obeyed the call by the Christian Association of Nigeria to, after the Sunday services, protest against the killings by Fulani herdsmen in Benue State and other parts of the country.
The CAN President, Rev. Olasupo Ayokunle, in a statement last Wednesday had said,
“CAN urges Christians in Nigeria to hold peaceful protest on the set aside date, on the premises of their churches, asking the Federal Government and security agencies to stop the unending killings and bloodshed in the country.”
