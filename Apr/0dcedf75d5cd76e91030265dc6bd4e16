First Lady, Aisha Buhari, says her sense of justice made her grant the BBC interview that many considered to be critical of her husband’s government.
Speaking on Saturday at the Vanguard Personality of the year 2017 awards, Aisha said she did not make those comments out of disrespect.
Recall that in 2016, Aisha in an interview with BBC alleged that Buhari’s government had been hijacked, threatening not to support her husband in 2019 if things continued same way.
The BBC interview was not the only time when Aisha disagreed with her husband in public. In January, she retweeted videos of senators who criticised her husband.
In July 2016, she said the “hyenas and jackals” in her husband’s kingdom would soon be sent packing.
Aisha, who was represented by Halima, one of her daughters, added that Nigerians elected her husband based on the trust and confidence they have in him and she felt the administration must serve Nigeria to the best of its ability.
“I wish to thank the management of Vanguard Media Limited for this unexpected award, in recognition of my humanitarian efforts towards improving the health and welfare of Nigerians particularly women, children and less privileged,” she said.
“One of the reasons adduced for honouring me was the interview I granted which some people saw as criticism to a government that I am part of. I need to state that my position was a result of my sense of justice and not confrontation or disrespect.
“I was brought up to stand by the truth and this is how I have always been. As we are all aware, Nigerians elected this administration based on the trust and confidence they have on my husband; I, therefore, feel that we are here to serve Nigeria to the best of our ability. Let me use this opportunity to state that I support my husband in this call to service and will continue to do so.”
