Artificial Intelligence workers in a state-owned bank in China are now running entire banking operations with no help from humans.
The robots can help customers open accounts, transfer money, change currency and even make investments.
And visitors can even explore the bank’s rental offerings using virtual reality headsets.
A robot at the “unmanned bank” greets customers at the entrance using voice recognition software.
Clients can scan their faces using the bank’s recognition device.
