The National Secretariat of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Abuja, has rejected the return of Senator Ali Modu Sheriff to the party through the secretariat. The leadership of the ruling party directed the former factional chairman of the main opposition party, the Peoples Democratic (PDP) to join the APC from his ward in Borno State instead of coming to its Abuja secretariat.
APC National Publicity Secretary, Mallam Bolaji Abdullahi, in a statement on Thursday, declared: “Our attention has been drawn to reports in some sections of the media that the former factional chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Senator Ali Modu Sheriff, plans to defect to the All Progressives Congress (APC) today at the APC National Secretariat in Abuja.
“While we are aware of such intentions, we wish to restate our earlier position that anyone who wants to join the Party should do so at the ward level. We are happy to welcome new members to our party, but membership cards are not issued at the Party National Secretariat. “
