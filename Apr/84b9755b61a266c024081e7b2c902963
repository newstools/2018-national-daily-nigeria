An aide to the Senate President, Bukola Saraki, Bamikole Omishore and his wife, Abiola Aiyegbayo-Omishore, are being probed by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) over alleged ghost worker scam.

According to the spokesman for the EFCC, Wilson Uwujaren, the probe on the couple was sequel to a petition against them. “I can confirm that the petition is before the commission and receiving necessary attention,” Uwujaren said.

National Daily learnt that the petition which was signed by Abba El-Mustapha on behalf of Youths United Against Corruption in Nigeria accused Omishore allegedly listing his wife as a grade level 12 employee of the National Assembly, though she is a nurse in the United States.

The document alleged that Omishore’s wife had been collecting salaries to the tune of N150, 000 for nearly three years through her bank account with the name Abiola Aiyegbayo.

The petition read in part: “Documents made available by a whistle-blower showed that Mr. Bamikole Omishore, one of the aides to Senate President Bukola Saraki, has made millions of naira through the complex but criminal scheme.

“Further information gathered revealed that Mr. Omishore, since his appointment, has purchased prime properties in Abuja and Lagos respectively. Our search in the Abuja Geographic Information Systems revealed that since his appointment as a special adviser, Omishore has purchased prime properties in Abuja and Lagos.

However, Bamikole Omishore, has stated that neither he nor his wife had received any copy of petition from EFCC or any other security agency. He said he will address issues contained in any petition against him when he received it.
