Some former students of the Covenant University, Ota, Ogun, have expressesd their disgust at the way the institution officially disfigured students wearing Afro hairstyle on videon going viral on social media.

Many Nigerians also felt disappointed at the recklessness as they watch the school’s officials using a pair of clippers to make huge breach in the heads of the students shown in the video.

Okoli Offorbuike, a former graduate of the school, said the action was disdainful, unbefitting  of “Kings and Queens” they call students of the university.

Offorbuike then posted old pictures of the General Overseers of the Living Faith Church, Bishop David Oyedepo, and the Redeemed Christian Church of God, Worldwide, Pastor Enoch Adeboye.

Both wore big hairstyle back then.

He called on the university alumni to facilitate the inclusion of a law in the students’ handbook that would accord the students honour, dignity and respect.

Other social media users also felt disappointed at the humiliation.

But some others said the students knew the terms and conditions attached to their studentshop there when they were applying for admission.

The school authorities have not responded yet.
