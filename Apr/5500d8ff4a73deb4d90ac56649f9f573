Adopts Oshiomhole for APC National Chairman




President Muhammadu Buhari is working assiduously to consolidate his new romance with Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, national leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the preparations for the 2019 elections. Apparently, the President appears to have succumbed to pressure to adopt former Edo State Governor, Aliyu Adams Oshiomhole, towards the party’s preparations for the May 14, 2018 National convention for election of new ;leaders of the ruling party.
Before now, 16 of the 24 APC governors were said to have ganged under the umbrella of pro-Buhari group in support of the re-election of current APC National Chairman, Chief John Odigie-Oyegun, at the convention; while eight APC governors were identified to be in alliance with Tinubu supporting the election of Oshiomhole as national chairman.
The president adopting Oshiomhole for APC national chairman, has ultimately sacrificed Oyegun on the altar of politics in preference of a fresh power re-alignment.
It was gathered that the president disclosed his support for Oshiomhole at the closed door meeting with 16 APC governors on Tuesday at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, where the governors reiterated their endorsement of President Buhari for re-election for second term in 2019.  The governors were led by chairman of the Progressives Governors’ Forum, Owelle Rochas Okorocha.
