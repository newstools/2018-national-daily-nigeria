Former Ex-International  and Flying Eagles coach, Emmanuel Amuneke has advised Super Eagles coach Gernot Rohr to get a result-yielding strategy to help his team combat oppositions at the forthcoming 2018 FIFA World Cup he told National Daily recently  during a chat.
Having utilised three different formations in their international friendly games against Argentina, Poland and Serbia, the Eagles are yet to make headway in getting a favourable tactic ahead the Mundial according to Amuneke.
“I believe it’s all about the formation; during the qualifiers, we focused more on wing play, using the exploit of Victor Moses and the rest, but we can see in recent games that it has not favoured us, especially against Serbia where they stopped us every time we went through the wings,” Amuneke told the National Daily.
“He has to have a tactic that the players will buy into and be able to achieve their objectives. It all depends on their own plan as a team and it’s that plan and style that will stand us out at the World Cup,” the ex-international added.
Amuneke added that “Nobody wants to lose, but losing provides you an opportunity to be realistic with yourself and your team.
“It will help them correct the errors and try to perfect them going forward,” the former Al Khartoum Watani manager said.
