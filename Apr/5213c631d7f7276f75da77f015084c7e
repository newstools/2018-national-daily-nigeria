Contrary to the report colleagues of hospitalised Sen. Dino Melaye gave the Senate that he had not been fed for two days, the Abuja National Hospital management has told the National Daily their patient is doing just fine.
Sen. Aba Na’ Allah led some senators to visit Melaye in the trauma care centre of the hospital on Wednesday.
He told the House that the police that detained him, and the hospital management , would not feed him because they feared being implicated in case things went awry.
Melaye had earlier protested in a video going viral that he would kill himself and get the police into trouble.
That threat apparently fuelled another speculation that he might be on hunger strike.
But Dr. Dayo Haastrup, the head of the hospital’s information services, told the National Daily the hospital has been giving him needed care.
“We have conducted our investigation, and we have been briniging in our experts and doctors to attend to him,” he said.
“When he is stable enough he will be discharged.”
When the National Daily asked Haastrup about the 48-hour-long hunger the senators reported to the chamber, he sounded puzzled.
“Who told you?”
He added that the senators truly came to see him.
“So he’s been eating well?”
“Yeah,” he said.
Melaye was arrested after a 20-hour siege between on Tuesday.
But the event escalated when the senator allegedly bailed out of the vehicle in which he was being transported by police to Kogi–for interrogation over his complicit in a gun-eunning allegations.
The senator has since been hospitalised for injuries he sustained, though guarded by armed police officers.
He tweeted 21 hours ago his relatives and lawyers were not allowed access to him.
