The Federal High Court in Abuja has ordered an interim forfeiture of two properties belonging to former First Lady Patience Jonathan.

The properties, located at Plot No. 1960, Cadastral Zone A05, Maitama District; and Plot No. 1350, Cadastral Zone A00, both in Abuja, were said to be held in the name of Ariwabai Aruera Reachout Foundation.

Patience is said to be one of the Foundation “trustees.”

In an ex parte application filed in September last year, the EFCC asked for an interim forfeiture of the properties claimed to be subjects of an ongoing investigation.

Justice Nnamdi Dimgba, ruling on Monday, dismissed Patience objection to the application for lacking in merit.

The judge then ordered the interim forfeiture, which he, however, ruled must only last for 45 days within which the EFCC must conclude its investigations and charge the suspects being investigated.

He added that the EFCC is at liberty to seek extension of the life span of the order before the expiration of the initial 45 days.

And if the EFCC’s officials need to access the properties while the forfeiture last, they must do so with the respondents in attendance.
