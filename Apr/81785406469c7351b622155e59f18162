A team of mobile and regular police officers have surrounded the Abuja home of Kogi Sen. Dino Melaye.
The team arrived at Mr Melayeâ€™s residence in Maitama District around 1 pm, hours after he was initially detained at the airport and prevented from travelling on an official trip to Morocco.
The Nigerian Immigration Service (NIS) detained Mr Melaye because he was on the police wanted list.
The police reportedly debunked the arrest, and Melaye walked away from the NIS officials.
In March, officers from the Special Anti-Robbery Squad laid a siege to the FCT High Court in Maitama, where Melaye had been arraigned and granted bail on separate charges earlier.
