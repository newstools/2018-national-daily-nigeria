The President of Botswana, Ian Khama, a retired army general, stepped down on Saturday after about 10 years in power. On resignation, he handed over power to his deputy, Mokgweetsi Masisi.
It was gathered that the new president Mokgweetsi Masisi emerged the third leader to preside over the southern African country outside the Khama political dynasty that has dominated national politics since independence from Britain in 1966.
“Masisi, 55, inherits a country that has for decades been heralded as a beacon of African democracy and sound economic management but faces a huge task of reducing the country’s dependence on diamonds,” it was highlighted.
