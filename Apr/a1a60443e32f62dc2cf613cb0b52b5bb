The Opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has accused President Muhammadu Buhari  of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) of plotting to intimidate, harass and arrest members of the Opposition party ahead of the 2019 elections.
The Opposition construed the list of alleged looters released by the federal government on Friday as deliberate ploy of blackmail to seek reasons to throw PDP members behind bars before the general elections. The government had named National Chairman of the PDP, Uche Secondus, founder of DAAR Communications, Raymond Dokpesi, among those who allegedly looted Nigeria’s treasury.
“The attention of the Peoples Democratic Party has been drawn to clandestine plots by certain agents of the federal government and the All Progressives Congress (APC) to clamp down on key members of the opposition parties ahead of the 2019 general election,” the party said in a series of tweets on Sunday.
Part of this heinous plot is also to arrest members of the civil society, opinion leaders, the media and professional groups who refused to buy into the fabrications, lies, deceptions and propaganda of the @APCNigeria and Federal Government. @MBuhari, the PDP declared.
“The first leg of this scheme is to commence a vicio intimidation and harassment of @OfficialPDPNig members who have refused to succumb to pressure to join the @APCNigeria in their undemocratic quest to create for a one party state in Nigeria,” the party said.
