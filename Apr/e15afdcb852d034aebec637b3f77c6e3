Kayode Opadokun, a son of Ayo Opadokun, has been listed by the police as one of the suspects arrested after raiding an Offa banking comminity weeks ago, killing nine cops and scores of others.

Opadokun is a lawyer and one of the chieftains of the pan-Yoruba group, Afenifere.
He is also an Awoist.

Kayode, the National Daily gathered, is the scion of the Opadokuns.

There are allegations he has been criminally-minded all along.

But many have risen to the defence of his father known as a man of integrity and principles.

“I have interacted closely with him and I can confirm to you that he is a distinguished gentleman, ” Wahab Shittu, a lawyer, told the Punch in an interview.

“He feels very embarrassed with what has happened and the fact that his venerable name is being associated with this evil.”

He insisted Opadokun, by principles, will not interfere in the matter.

Most of the suspects arrested so far are members of the Offa community.

No fewer than 30 robbers invaded the community with arms and ammunition and explosives.
