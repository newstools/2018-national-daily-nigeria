President Muhammadu Buhari of Nigeria will meet American President Donald Trump in Washington on April 30.
The purpose of the meeting, according to a White House release on Sunday, is to discuss issues including “fighting terrorism” and economic growth.
Trump, who once referred to Nigeria and other African countries as shitholes, will be discussing ways to enhance strategic partnership and advance shared priorities in promoting economic growth and reforms, fighting terrorism and other threats to peace and security, and building on Nigeria’s role as a democratic leader in the region.
“The relationship of the United States with Nigeria is deep and strong, and Nigeria’s economic growth, security, and leadership in Africa will advance our mutual prosperity,” the release stated.
Nigeria is among countries facing Islamist extremism, and has been getting help from the US.
Although the problem predates Buhari’s administration, it has nonetheless embarrassed the APC  government.
Defeated technically, according to Aso Rock, Boko Haram has sustained suicide missions and kidnap for ransom in the last three years.
