FIFA has issued a life ban to the president of the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF), Marco Polo Del Nero.

The ban, which covers all football-related activities at both national and international level, takes immediate effect.

Del Nero is accused of taking bribes in exchange for awarding contracts to companies for the media and marketing rights to various football tournaments, including the Copa America and Copa Libertadores.

“The decision was notified to Mr Del Nero today, and the ban came into force immediately upon notification,” said a FIFA statement released on Friday.

Del Nero has been fined one million Swiss francs (£734,344) as part of the ruling.

CBF vice-president Antonio Carlos Nunes de Lima will take over from Del Nero following the executive’s life ban.
