There was a mild drama on Tuesday afternoon following the attempted escape of Dino Melaye, Senator representing Kogi West from a police van that eventually landed him in Zankili Medical Centre, Abuja.

National Daily gathered that the senator was reportedly being led to court by the policemen on Tuesday afternoon when he attempted to escape. He was said to have immediately jumped out of the vehicle, sustaining injuries in the process.

A man who followed the ambulance that conveyed the senator to the hospital said he witnessed the “drama” leading to the injury.

He was said to have been brought into the hospital after sustaining injuries in a bid to escape.

The hospital ambulance brought him to the hospital around 4:25pm, after which he was admitted into the emergency unit.

Addressing journalists at the hospital, the man simply identified as Peter said: “I was there at Area 1 when the police vehicle stopped somewhere and amid the confusion, there were shouts of ‘shoot him, shoot him’.

“It was later this afternoon, while he was being taken to court, around that Area 1, the crowd had gathered and the police officers were there with him. I don’t know if he was pushed out of the vehicle or not but amid the confusion, they later moved him from there.”

It would be recalled that security operatives on Monday laid siege to his house after he was detained at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja, and prevented from travelling abroad.
 




The police had earlier declared him wanted over allegations of supplying arms to crime suspects. The police are yet to release any official statement regarding the recent developments.
