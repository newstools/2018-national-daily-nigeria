The Buhari Media Support Group (BMSG) which transmuted into the Buhari Media Organisation (BMO) with greater focus on resetting the tone of political conversation in the country has unveiled its new logo ahead of the 2019 elections.

While unveiling the new name and logo at a media parley on Friday, April 20, in Abuja, a former minister of information and communication, Alhaji Ibrahim Dasuki Nakande noted that, “for too long, we have allowed the opposition to take control of the media space while we will now be reacting.”

He said the Buhari administration has a lot of masses oriented programmes and policies which must be publicised for Nigerians to understand the trajectory of the administration.

“Our job is not against anybody but about how to move the nation forward. In a football match, you have the supporters club whose job ends as the game ends. “So, we thought it fit to metamorphose into an organization that will be most enduring and serve as a catalyst for development. The idea is to bring together all groups that have been supporting the president in this sector so that we can have an all-encompassing organization”, he said.

Earlier, the coordinator of the BMO, Austin Braimoh, said the organization has been able to do a self-evaluation and identified its shortcomings with a view to enhancing the electoral fortunes of the president at the next general elections.

President Muhammadu at the All Progressives Congress (APC) NEC meeting last week announced that he would seek reelection in the 2019 presidential election.
