Protesters are currently in front of the house of Sen. Dino Melaye under siege since Monday afternoon.
The protesters demand that security operatives leave the place.
Men of the Nigeria Police Force and he Department of State Services (DSS) descended on the residence shortly after the senator was detained and released by the Nigeria Immigration Service in the morning.
There is restriction on movement on Sangha street, Maitama, where Melaye’s house is located.
Some of Melaye’s colleagues were also not allowed to see him.
Abiodun Olujimi from Ekiti, Philip Aduda, (FCT), Isa Misau from Bauchi and Atai Idoko, Kogi were among the senators who visited Melaye.
The protesters comprised people from an internally displaced persons (IDP) camp in Abuja.
Leader of the group told reporters that no individual has taken care of IDPs like in Abuja Melaye.
“We heard they have arrested Senator Dino Melaye because of the truth he has been speaking. We have not seen any senator that can speak the truth like Dino,” he said.
“We have more than 36 camps in Abuja and Nasarawa. It’s only Dino Melaye that can visit the IDPs. He gives us food items, drugs and books for our children . We will not allow any bad thing to touch him.”
Melaye’s counsel, who identified himself as Ajayi Jaiye, said he has not been able to contact his client.
Jaye described the action of the security agencies as a gross violation of the fundamental human rights of his client.
