The Nigerian Army is launching a new operation to  destroy Boko Haram it once claimed was techincally defeated..
Maj.-Gen David Ahmadu, the Chief of Training and Operations, said the new operation will last four months.
“And it will entail deployment of 6 additional manoeuvre brigades and other critical assets in Borno State‎,” Mr Ahmadu said.
Mr Chukwu, however, said the new operation will ensure the destruction of Boko Haram Terrorist camps and strong points in the Lake Chad Basin.
“The operation will also facilitate the rescue of hostages,” he said.
More than 100,000 people are believed to have died from the Boko Haram insurgency raging in Borno, Adamawa, and Yobe since 2009.
The terrorists have been carrying out mostly suicide attacks on civilian and military targets.
