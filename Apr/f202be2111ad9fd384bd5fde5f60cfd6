Liverpool are reportedly set to lose Mohamed Salah  for their final two Premier League games of the season following the Egyptian forward’s clash with Bruno Martins Indi.
Salah, who currently leads the scoring charts with 31 goals to his name, appeared to flail a balled hand towards the Stoke City centre-back during Saturday’s 0-0 draw at Anfield.
The incident was not spotted by referee Andre Marriner at the time and could therefore be referred to a three-man panel of former officials to rule if it was worthy of a red card.
According to The Sun, Football Association chiefs have been alerted to social media clips of the rumpus and Salah’s fate is now said to be in their hands.
Under FA rules, the PFA Player of the Year will miss the final two league games of this campaign and the first of next season if the panel unanimously decide it was a sending-off offence.
The report suggests that Salah will discover by Monday evening whether he faces a violent conduct charge.
