The founder and General Overseer of the Living Faith Church, Bishop David Oyedepo, at the weekend berated President Muhammadu Buhari over the unending killing of innocent Nigerians by herdsmen.
The Bishop, during Sunday service, expressed his disgust against the All Progressives Congress (APC) government for having no feeling for human lives.
Oyedepo further chided the federal government over epileptic power supply, dead refineries and high exchange of dollar to naira.
“Can I tell you my anger against this government? No feeling for human lives. You can’t be destroying the work of my father and I will be happy with you. You know what God said; I am angry with the wicked every day.
“Talk is cheap! You see where change brought us today since 2015? The changes change,” the Bishop declared inter alia.
