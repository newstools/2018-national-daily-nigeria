Festus Keyamo Chambers has refuted claims that the Supreme Court sacked Amaju Pinnick and the NFF board.
Keyamo in a statement on Friday by Festus Ukpe, Esq and Arinze S. Egbo, Esq, counsels to Pinnick, noted that the Supreme Court of Nigeria on Friday morning delivered Judgment in Appeal No. SC/731/2016 between YAHAYA ADAMA & 1 OTHER v. AMINU MAIGARI & 3 OTHERS.
The chambers highlighted that “the summary of the Supreme Court Judgment in plain language is that the complaint of Giwa and his supporters should be taken back to the Federal High Court so that they can be properly heard and the case determined one way or the other.” They affirmed: “So, the Supreme Court overturned the decision of the Court of Appeal which struck out the case of Giwa and his supporters that they should not be heard at all.”
The Keyamo Chambers declared accordingly, “Supreme Court did not remove Amaju Pinnick from office. The Supreme Court did not also sack the NFF Board from office. In fact, the Supreme Court, specifically, refused the prayers of Giwa and his supporters that the Supreme Court should determine the whole case and remove Amaju Pinnick from office under Section 22 of the Supreme Court Act.”
The Chambers cautioned against “the fake news being peddled by Giwa and his supporters that the Amaju Pinnick led Board has been sacked from office and he has been installed,” admonishing that, “no such thing happened at all; the public should be properly guided please.”
