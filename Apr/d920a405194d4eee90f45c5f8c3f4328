Barcelona’s 3-0 defeat away to Roma has entered now into the list of disasters for the Catalan club with the 4-1 victory at home not being sufficient and it will not be forgotten quickly by the fans, especially with so much talk of a treble.

It is the first time that they have lost a three goal lead in Europe and it was back in the 1984/85 when they last had a similar disappointment at the hands of Metz when they let slip a 4-2 win at home by losing 4-1.

A year before that Manchester United overcame a 2-0 loss at the Camp Nou by winning 3-0 at home.

A famous black night for Barcelona was when they were beaten by Steaua Bucharest in the final of the European Cup in 1986. The match went to penalties and Barcelona failed to score any of their spot-kicks as the Romanians won.

Then having finally won the European Cup in 1992 under Johan Cruyff, two years later, still with the Dutchman in charge they were taken apart in the final in Athens by Milan and went down 4-0.

Real Madrid also knocked Barcelona out at the semi final stage as they went on to win their ninth European crown. Zidane and McManaman got the goals as Barcelona went down 2-0 at the Camp Nou and then drew 1-1 away.

In the 2012/13 season Barcelona played Bayern Munich in the semi finals of the Champions League and after winning 4-0 at home, the Germans then came out 3-0 victors away.
