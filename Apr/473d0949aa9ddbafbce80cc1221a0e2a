The former Governor of Borno State, Senator Modu Ali Sheriff, has revealed his preparedness to return to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) after the end of his adventure for conflicts in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).
It was gathered that Sheriff will be returning to the ruling party with his supporters, essentially, the loyalists in the PDP who joined forces with him in the months of the leadership crisis that destabilized the PDP, and almost destroyed the party.
Since losing the leadership suit at the Supreme Court, Sheriff and his team have not been able to reintegrate themselves into the PDP leadership that subsequently elected Prince Uche Secondus the partyâ€™s national chairman.
National chairman of the APC, Chief John Odigie-Oyegun, was said to be waiting to receive Sherriff and his supporters back to the APC which he had dumped to embrace PDP.
