A prominent leader in northern Nigeria, Dr. Junaid Mohammed, has admonished that Nigerians will regret it if they vote President Muhammadu Buhari into office for second term in 2019.
After President Buhari had declared his intention to seek re-election in 2019 at the All Progressives Congress (APC) National Executive Committee meeting in Abuja on Monday, Junaid Mohammed was gathered to have expressed that it was left for Nigerians to decide whether Buhari will get another term or not.
 “I believe nobody should be surprised about Buhari’s declaration.
“Why? Because Buhari is a kind of man that cares less about Nigerians and wants to hold on to power as long as he can.
“It is now left for Nigerians to decide whether he stays on or not.
“What I can boldly say is that if Buhari wins another term in office, there will not be end to corruption, insurgency, and insecurity.
“His loyalists and cronies will continue to milk the country,” Junaid Mohammed was cited to have said.
