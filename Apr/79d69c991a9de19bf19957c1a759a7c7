The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the Accord Party in Oyo State have ridiculed President Muhammadu Buhari over his declaration of intention on Monday to seek re-election in 2019. The Parties were of the view that the declaration has made the 2019 elections easier to be won on their platforms.
Oyo PDP State Secretary, Wasiu Emiola, stated that Buhari’s declaration has further made it easier for the PDP to defeat APC in the 2019 presidential election.
John Igbinsola, State Secretary of Accord Party, remarked that President Buhari is a joker to have declared for second term.
Igbinsola decried that cabals in the ruling APC had pressured the President to re-contest because of their selfish interests.
“President Buhari is acting the scripts of certain politicians that want to further enslave the masses through anti-people policies.
“But Accord Party will present a credible presidential candidate that will wrest power from APC in 2019,” Igbinsola had declared.
The secretaries observed that President Buhari’s declaration to seek re-election has brightened the chances of their politicla parties.
Emiola, PDP State Secretary, postulated that the APC-led Federal Government has lost credibility after three years of poor performance.
The PDP State Secretary emphasized that APC government was characterized by nepotism, adding that the anti-corruption war of the Buhari administration was below the expectations of Nigerians.
“President Buhari’s re-election bid will not get the support of the masses as against what it was in 2015,” Emiola had declared.
