Enyeama had played two games for Lille B (the second team of his French Ligue 1 club Lille) in the  French fourth-tier Championnat National 2, before Sunday’s 2-1 defeat to St Maur Lusitanos as he worked his way back to full fitness after suffering a cruciate knee ligament injury last year.

Enyeama took to his Twitter handle to show appreciation for the squad, stating that the memories he had with the team will linger on for forever.

“I want to say thank you so much to the coaches, players, doctor, and physiotherapists of the CFA team of LOSC for this wonderful year. You took me as one of yours; you gave me hope for a new start. These pictures and memories will last forever in my heart. God bless you,” Enyeama tweeted.

Enyeama is in the final year of his contract at Lille and could be on his way out of the club this summer.
