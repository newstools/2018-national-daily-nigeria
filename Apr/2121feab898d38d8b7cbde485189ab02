Following a report by The Boss published by Dele Momodu that Senate President Bukola Saraki is down for the presidency in 2019, the No 3 citizen has responded, describing the report as false.

“The Boss can exclusively reveal that Senate President, Dr. Abubakar Bukola Saraki has joined the 2019 Presidential race,” the paper reported last weekend.

The report highlighted how Saraki would be a formidable force that can’t be ignored in the scheme of things come 2019.

“Only few politicians in Nigeria today have the pedigree, the experience, the clout and the connection of Senator Saraki.”

But Yusuph Olaniyonu, special adviser on media and publicity to Saraki, told the Daily Independent on Monday there was no iota of truth in the report.

The paper also went ahead to refer to impeccable sources revealing Saraki’s game plan  for the election.

“As he plots his move for the Presidency, he is said to be considering building alliances with all Nigerians of like minds,” The Boss reported.

“Having already exhibited the ability to work seamlessly with politicians from the two main political parties, it is a path he can easily thread.”

It was also reported that Saraki, an APC stalwart, will be pairing with his Deputy Senate President Ike Ekweremadu from the PDP.

However, Olaniyonu said it’s all a speculation, adding if it is true, Nigerians would have seen the report in major newspapers since last Saturday when the news broke out on social media.

The ruling APC has been swamped in lots of speculations on who is running for the presidency in 2019.

The wild guesses are fuelled by the silence of President Muhammadu Buhari on his intention for a second term–despite how his ministers and APC governors are working to push him into the race.
