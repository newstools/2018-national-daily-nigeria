One of the ardent supporters of President Muhammadu Buhari, Governor Okorocha of Imo state says he will succeed Buhari in 2023 after the president might have served his two terms.

The governor said this on Monday when he hosted some political stakeholders at the state government house in Owerri who had come to endorse Uche Nwosu, his chief of staff and son-in-law, as the next governor of the state.

Okorocha said Buhari’s declaration for a second term is a good development and that he will win again, just like he did in 2015”.

“Buhari will win again and again. After Buhari, the turn will come to south-east and it will be the turn of Okorocha,” he said.

Reacting to criticism of his endorsement of Nwosu as his successor, the governor said his (Nwosu’s) “only sin” is that he is my son-in-law.

He said the governorship aspirant is better qualified than any other contender.

“Nwosu is the least of the political children I have trained but I don’t know any of them as much as I have known Nwosu,” Okorocha said.

“I took him up when he was just nobody and he grew to the height he is now, his only sin is that he is my son-in-law.

“Nwosu will win in 2019, don’t be afraid, I am there, I have retired the Arthur Nzeribes, the Udenwas, now I will retire the rest of them finally, I know them and they know me, their plan is to push me so that they can get the senate, it’s a lie, I will run for the senate as well.”
