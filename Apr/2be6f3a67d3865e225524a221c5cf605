Monica Osagie, a post-graduate student of the Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), Ile Ife, Osun State, who is alleged a victim of sexual abuse by one Professor Akindele has received an invitation to appear before the investigative panel on Tuesday (tomorrow).
it was gathered that the school extended the invitation to the student after her lawyer and Executive Director of Women Advocates Research and Documentation Centre, Dr. Abiola Akiyode-Afolabi, had made public that the victim was yet to receive invitation to testify before any panel of investigation.
Akiyode-Afolabi had said that Osagie, “resorted to self-help” through audio recording after two lecturers approached by her for intervention refused to help her.”
The letter dated April 19, 2018 and entitled: “Re: Investigative panel on alleged harassment of a female student: Detailed audio recording: Request for the presentation of Miss Osagie Monica Oselode”, was signed by the OAU Deputy Registrar and Post-Graduate College Secretary, Mrs. A.O. Fadeyibi.
The letter read:
“I write at the instance of the Provost, Post-Graduate College, to invite you to appear before the investigative panel on alleged harassment of a female student detailed in audio recording at its meeting which will come up at 10:00am on Tuesday April 24, 2018.
“Please be informed that on arrival, you are required to call the Secretary to the panel to facilitate your appearance before the panel. Thank you.”
Prof. Akindele was accused to have allegedly demanded five rounds of sex in exchange of examination marks from Miss Osagie. The audio went viral on social media in the past weeks and generated mountains of controversies in the public.
