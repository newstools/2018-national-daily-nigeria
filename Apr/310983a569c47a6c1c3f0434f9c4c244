Oba of Lagos, Rilwan Akiolu says President Muhammadu Buhari will get the votes of the state if his government gives Lagos a special status state.

The monarch stated this while speaking during the second quarter of 2018 town hall meeting with residents of Apapa with Governor Akinwunmi Ambode.

According to the monarch, he expected Asiwaju Bola Tinubu to have discussed the issue of special status with Buhari, adding that he once wrote to the National Assembly on the matter.

“I have given a condition to President Muhammad Buhari ahead of 2019 saying the only way the people of Lagos will support his second term re-election ambition is to grant the state a special status,” the Oba said at the meeting.

“During the recent visit of President Muhammadu Buhari to Lagos, I wanted to ask him that it was God and All Progressives Congress (APC) that helped to bring him to power. And that he must satisfy Lagos,” Akiolu said while emphasising that President Buhari must reconsider the special status for the state to deliver massive support for his second term in 2019.

Recall that for many years, the state government and notable residents have clamoured for a special status for the state, even after the Senate rejected a bill seeking to officially recognize Lagos as Nigeria’s commercial capital in 2016.
