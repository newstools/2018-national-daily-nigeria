The Police have arrested Senator, Ovie Omo-Agege, over the stolen mace from the Senate on Wednesday during a plenary sitting. The Police will be commencing the conduct of investigation over the mayhem at the Senate on Wednesday in which the plenary session of the Senate was obstructed and the Mace violently taken away by a thug.
Senator Omo-Agege, who is on 90 days suspension had intruded into the National Assembly in the protection of some hoodlums, including five aides who escorted him to the entrance point into the chambers.
Security operatives, accordingly, went into swift action, blocking all entrance and exit routes to the National Assembly complex.

Senator Shehu Sani had declared: “The Senate invaded; Mace taken away; Deliberations on whether to adjourn or not. I and others insisted that the Senate must not adjourn. I removed my waist Belt and lay to serve as a Mace for us to continue; my colleagues seconded. Then, a spare Mace brought in and the session continued. Good Drivers are not known when the road is smooth.”
In live telecast coverage of the incident monitored from Lagos, the hoodlums threw the National Assembly into pandemonium Wednesday afternoon when they invaded the Senate Chambers during plenary sitting and violently stole the Mace. The Senators were helpless as they were taken unaware, they were rather stunned in shock of the threat to their security, while a young man stormed out of the Chamber with the Mace lifted above his head, probably, ready to use it the hit anyone who dares stood on his way.
Attempts to stop other hoodlums led to the throwing of chairs by the Sergeants-At-Arms, which led to sustenance of injury by one of the SAAs.  Thereafter, relative normalcy was restored and the senators resumed sitting, insisting that an adjournment would imply the evaders have won.
