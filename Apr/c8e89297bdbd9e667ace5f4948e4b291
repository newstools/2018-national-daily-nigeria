President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda at the week end lamented that “President Muhammadu Buhari is the worst President that ever happens to that great country, Nigeria…” bemoaning that “a leader should not expose his citizens.”
The Ugandan President was responding to the diplomatic flaw of the Nigerian President at the Commonwealth Business Summit last week where President Buhari made a controversial statement that Nigerian youths  sit and do nothing expecting to free housing, free education, etc, because Nigeria is an oil producing country.
Yoweri Museveni, in a statement, declared: “Nigeria is a great and an outstanding country in Africa because of the youth of that country…. Our people have an Africanized social life all over Africa is because Nigerian youth put their full hardworking efforts. Look at the movie industry, and most outstanding, the music industry….”
The Ugandan President further stated that, “Buhari can never outgrow the slave and master mentality; He keeps talking bad about his people any time he makes a trip. Britain is there to exploit and steal just what they are known for. He seizes to understand that Britain created that country and gave it all the flaws that will never make it grow beyond a limit.”
“Nigerians will vote him out. It is obvious there is nothing Britain can do about it… If he tries to annul or rig the election, he will face a wide loss of legitimacy. Nigerians are patiently waiting to send him back to retirement,” Yoweri Museveni declared.
