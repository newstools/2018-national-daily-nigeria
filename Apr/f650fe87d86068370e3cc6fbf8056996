Indigenous students of Lagos State in tertiary institutions across the country and beyond on Wednesday staged a solidarity walk to Lagos House in Alausa, Ikeja, to throw their weight behind the State Governor, Akinwunmi Ambode, for a second term in office.
The students, who embarked on the walk under the auspices of the National Union of Lagos State Students (NULASS), said the decision to publicly identify with and support the Governor for re-election in 2019 was on account of the various laudable initiatives of the Governor to reposition and scale up education sector in the State, as well as massive infrastructural projects across the State.
Speaking on behalf of the students, NULASS President, Qudus Adeniyi (a.k.a Ajasco), said the positive impact of the giant strides of Governor Ambode since assumption of office had been felt across all sectors and sections of the State.
He said: “We are here to applaud and appreciate the good works of our world class Governor and daddy, Mr Akinwunmi Ambode. From the first day in office, he has been doing good works in every facet of our dear State.
“If you talk of infrastructure, the Governor is doing well; talk of good road network, the Governor is there; talk of laudable initiatives for education system in the State, the Governor is there.
“For instance, the Governor introduced a program tagged Ready.Set.Work (RSW) to equip final year students in all the tertiary institutions in the State with the necessary employability skills and also to be employers of labour. These and many more are the reasons behind our resolve to endorse the Governor for another term in office, Adeniyi said.
The Commissioner for Special Duties and Inter-governmental Relations, Hon Seye Oladejo commended the students for the solidarity walk, saying it was an opportunity for government to get feedback from students, who according to him, are an important and germane segment of the society.
