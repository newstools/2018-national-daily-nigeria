Presidential spokesman, Femi Adesina on Tuesday said President Buhari will never join issues with former President Olusegun Obasanjo despite his criticisms.

Obasanjo had on Monday fired yet another shot at President Muhammadu Buhari at the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library, Abeokuta, Ogun State, saying his government has failed.

The former President also warned Nigerians against “reinforcing failure” through re-electing ineffective and incompetent government, asking the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to stop giving excuses.

“The first lesson I learnt in my military training is to never reinforce failure. What we have now is a failure,” he said.
 
He said the President has a “poor understanding” of the dynamics of internal politics and warned Nigerians against reinforcing failure by re-electing him in 2019.
 
In response, Adesina said Obasanjo’s comments are “not different” from the letter he wrote to Buhari in January.

He said Obasanjo was Buhari’s superior in the military, and as such, the president “will never join issues” with him.

“The thing I will like us to establish is that President Muhammadu Buhari will never join issues with former president Olusegun Obasanjo,” he said in a telephone interview on Channels Television.

“Former president Obasanjo was his superior in the military. President Buhari was a minister under his military regime, so President Buhari will never join issues with him.

“What former president Obasanjo has just said is not different from what he said in his letter of January 23 and an adequate response has been given to that letter by the minister of information, Lai Mohammed.

“The response that Alhaji Mohammed gave to that letter suffices for whatever Obasanjo has said. It’s an opinion and the thing about opinions is that they are free.”
