Following the theft of the mace form the Senate on Wednesday, there is a huge presence of security operatives on the National Assembly Complex premises Thursday.
Soldiers and policemen are now standing guard on the premises, an aberration in a democracy.
The sergeants-at-arms are also doing body pat and other security checks on workers and guests allowed in.
The security alert is even getting the operatives confused about their roles in the preventive measure.
Some soldiers and policemen in the adjoining area between the Senate and the House of Repswere seen arguing over the operating procedure.
But the Divisional Police Officer of the National Assembly Division, Mr. A Sulu-Gambari quickly moved in to resolve that.
Thugs linked to suspended Sen. Ovie Omo-Agege barged into the chamber Wednesday and made away with the staff of authority.
The senator was later escorted out of the complex, making many speculate he was arrested.
Omo-Agege however came back later to join his colleagues.
