The only secretariat of the PDP in Osun has been invaded by Senator Iyiola Omisore’s supporters who lowered and burned the party flags, destroyed the party logos, signposts, among others.

The inident took place on Thursday at the party head office along the Osogbo/Gbongan Expressway, Osogbo.

A faction led by Mr. Soji Adagunodo had earlier moved its own secretariat to the Bisket area along Ikirun Road.

The Dr. Bayo Faforiji-led faction, which is loyal to Omisore, met at the venue for a routine congress congress attended by Omisore, former deputy national chairman of the PDP Tajudeen Oladipo, former Minister of Police Affairs Jelili Adesiyan; and other chieftains of the party.

Although Omisore would not speak to journalists, the Director-General of the faction, Bade Falade, told journalists that Omisore and other members of the faction remain in the PDP.

He said the faction was worried with the manner the congresses of the party were conducted about two weeks ago without inviting the Faforiji faction to participate.

‘Our supporters are aggrieved… and they have genuine reasons to be aggrieved but the burning of the flags was not done at our own instance. They did it on their own.” he said.

“When the case in court is determined, then we will know the next step to take.”
