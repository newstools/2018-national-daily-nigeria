Nigerians in London demand stoppage of Fulani herdsmen killings




Opposition against the re-election of President Muhammadu Buhari has spread beyond Nigeria’s continental shelf into the United Kingdom.
While President Buhari left the Nigerian shores on Monday for London, the United Kingdom, Nigerians resident in London confronted him with protest on Tuesday over his declaration on Monday to seek re-election in 2019 for second term. F
The protesters assembled at the Abuja House, London, where they displayed several placards communicating their grievances to the Nigerian President and the international community.
The protesters demanded President Buhari to “stop bloodthirsty Fulani herdsmen now;” advocating: “we don’t want another Rwanda;” and accordingly, advocating that President Buhari should “Protect human being not cows!”
Buhari is in London on vacation where he is scheduled to visit Prime Minister Theresa May for bilateral talks.
He will also meet other dignitaries, including Nigerians in London to discuss matters of national interest.
