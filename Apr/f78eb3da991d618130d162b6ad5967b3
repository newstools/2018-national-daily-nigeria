In its efforts to deliver the Pen Cinema Flyover on schedule, the Lagos State Government on Friday, announced that there would be further restriction of vehicular movement at the Agege Intersection between Railway crossing and Church Street along Agunbiade Street in Agege.
The Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Works and Infrastructure, in a statement on Friday, indicated that due to the restriction, vehicles coming from Ipaja road towards Ogba would no longer be able to turn left at Oke-Koto, but will be required to go straight towards Agege Motor road and take left turn to connect the alternative route beside Agege Post Office to link Moshalashi Alhaji and further their journey.
The Permanent Secretary also advised motorists coming from Old Abeokuta Motor Road (Abule Egba) towards Oke-Koto/Alfa Nla roads to turn right at Abattoir into Oko-Oba road to link Orile Road and further their journey to NITEL into Orile road and then turn into Fagbola/Adejobi Street to navigate into Agege Motor road via Kasumu Street, Off Agunbiade road.
While regretting the inconveniences the restriction would cause motorists and residents, the State Government appealed for calm and cooperation with traffic and security personnel deployed to ease their movement, noting that the present administration was committed to delivering the project on schedule so as to make life easy and improve traffic along the corridor.
