One of the commercial banks attacked in Offa incident, Kwara, has sacked five of its workers for releasing the CCTV footage of the robbery to the public.
The bank’s management viewed the release of the footage without official approval as “gross indiscipline,” capable of affecting the security and image of the bank.
On April 5, armed robbers invaded five banks in Offa, Kwara State, killing scores of residents, including policemen, bank workers and passersby.
The robbers were said to have carted away millions of naira as they robbed the banks for about one hour without any challenge from security agents.
According Kwara’s Commissioner of Police Ado Lawan, the casualty figure stood at 17, including nine policemen killed by the robbers.
But the Operations Commander, Vigilance Group of Nigeria, Offa, Kwara State chapter, Wasiu Adepoju, said vigilantes in the state counted 50 dead bodies.
A video clip of how the robbers invaded the bank the incident hit the internet shortly after the incident.
The leak, however, surprised the management of the bank, thereby sacking five of its staff responsible for it.
In the meantime, some of the police officers in the division have been suspected of colluding with the robbers.
There were reports that the Divisional Crime Officer and the Divisional Police Officer of the Offa Police Station allegedly failed to take necessary actions before the robbers attacked.
It was also said that the robbers only collected the phones of the DPO and the DCO and allowed them to escape.
Responding, the state’s Police Public Relations Officer, Mr. Ajayi Okasanmi, said the Nigeria Police Force would also deal with anyone linked to the robbery.
While confirming that investigation was ongoing, he noted that the police is determined to get to the root of persistent robberies in Offa.
