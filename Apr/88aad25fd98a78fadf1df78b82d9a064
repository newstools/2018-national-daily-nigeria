The Chairperson of the Nigeria Women Football League, Aisha Falode, has applauded the executive committee of the Nigeria Football Federation for its magnanity towards ensuring a better women’s football league in Nigeria.

The NWFL boss told National Daily that she is delighted at the latest development coming from the Amaju Pinnick- led board, which she described  very pro-active and progressive.

The Board’s decision read thus: The Board approved that from the sponsorship funds that have accrued to the Federation over the past few months, a lump sum be granted to the Nigeria National League (NNL), Nigeria Nation-Wide League One (NLO) and the Nigeria Women Football League (NWFL) as support fund. A decision was also taken to support the three Leagues with a minimum of N200 million (to be shared based on an agreed ratio) annually until they attain financial stability.

This commitment is to be reviewed each year to determine which League needs more support. However, Committee made it clear that this should not stop the three Leagues from making great efforts to procure sponsors and become self -financing.”

“I am very happy that finally the NFF has demonstrated that they have a listening ear and very eager to see the women’s league develop.

She promised a better and bigger 2017/2018 season which will be going into matchday three this weekend.
