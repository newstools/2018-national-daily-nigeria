Controversial acting Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Ibrahim Magu, was among three Deputy Commissioners of Police (DCPs) screened for hours on Tuesday by the Mike Okiro-led Police Service Commission (PSC).

National Daily gathered that the three DCPs were screened for promotion to the rank of Commissioners of Police (CPs).

One of the DCPs was Ebere Onyeagoro, currently in charge of Administration, Kaduna State Police Command, while the third DCP was said to be from the South-West, and due for retirement in June.

Our investigations, however, revealed that the fourth DCP invited by the PSC for the screening was President Muhammadu Buhari’s Principal Staff Officer (PSO), DCP Abdulkarim Dauda.

Dependable sources at the PSC and Force Headquarters, Louis Edet House, Abuja, confirmed to newsmen that the “three DCPs passed the screening and the commission has approved their promotions to CPs.”

One of the sources disclosed that PSO to President Buhari could not be promoted because he did not appear before the commission.

“We don’t know if he will pass the screening, so we cannot promote somebody we don’t know whether he will pass or not,” one of the sources disclosed.
