The National Economic Council (NEC) has proposed a ban on the movement of herdsmen in the country.

The ban will be effective in Benue, Taraba, Adamawa, Kaduna and Plateau.

Presided over by Vice-President Yemi OsinbajoÂ on Thursday, the council also approved the creation of ranches across the country.

Dave Umahi, governor of Ebonyi state, told State House correspondents at the end of the NEC meeting held at the presidential villa in Abuja.

Umahi said the five mainly affected states which have witnessed killings from the herdsmen/farmers clashes, are expected to make land available for ranches.

With the ranching, the herdsmen and their families would be able to access good medical facilities and good schools for their children if they stay in one place.

Ranching, he added, would also improve the well-being of the cattle.

Umahi also disclosed that the federal government and the affected states will still iron out the interventions expected from the two parties.

Herdsmen from neighbouring countries would be expected to show some travel documents, even though visa is not allowed for movement of those from West African countries.

On his part, Audu Ogbeh, minister of agriculture, said the federal government will no longer allow the killings to continue.

Ogbeh said Nigeria may no longer be able to keep to the ECOWAS protocol on free movement of persons.

NEC comprises state governors and relevant ministries of government and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).
