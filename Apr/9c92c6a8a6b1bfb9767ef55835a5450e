Departs Nigeria for London on April 9




President Muhammadu Buhari commences his annual leave early April. He is scheduled to depart Nigeria for London, the United Kingdom, on Monday, April 9, 2018, for a resting place overseas.
A source from the Presidency was gathered to have explained that  the President is departing Nigeria early to enable him have sufficient rest before participating in the 25th Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, CHOGOM 2018, holding at the Buckingham Palace, St. James Palace, and Windsor Castle, the United Kingdom.
The 25th Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, CHOGOM 2018 is scheduled for April 16 to April 20, 2018. Nigeria is among the 53 countries that constitute the Commonwealth, a community of former British colonies that work cooperatively to promote prosperity, democracy and peace in the post-colonial era.
However, details of the president’s annual leave are yet to be unfolded. The duration of the leave and the years of coverage remain an official reserve of the Presidency.
Curiously, the president is proceeding on the annual vacation at a time Nigeria is heated with politics of 2019, the wanton killings by Fulani herdsmen continue unabated, the Boko Haram insurgents onslaught persists.
