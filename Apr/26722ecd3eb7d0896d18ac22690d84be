Nigeria Women’s Football Advocates will be in Lafia on Saturday, April 7 for the opening match of the 2017-18 Nigeria Women Football League (NWFL) season.
Moses Bako, chairman of the Save Women Football Foundation, who is also a women’s football advocate, made the disclosure while speaking about the new league campaign.
Bako told National Daily that the chairperson of the NWFL, Aisha Falode for the feat achieved in the outgoing campaign, has backed the league board for success this term.
He, however, appealed to the NWFL to continue to strive hard for the rebranding of the country’s topflight women’s football league, which he believes could attract sponsors.
“First and foremost, I will like to use this medium to congratulate madam Aisha Falode for the achievements she and the NWFL board members have had so far,” he began.
“Since taking over the affairs of the NWFL, the domestic women’s soccer league have gained massive audience on television, radio and social media.
“The NWFL is now a colourful football league with glitz and glamour, where every young girl want to feature and become a future star for her family and for the country.
He added: “With the way things are going, I strongly believe that the current board under the leadership of Aisha Falode will bring about the changes we’ve been craving for.
“All hands must be on deck for the rebranding of our local leagues, both the first and second divisions, so as to attract sponsors and even foreign players.
“From what have we’ve seen so far, talking about the Super Four event in Benin City, Edo state; NWFL Championship Shield in Lagos state and the partnership with La Liga, NWFL is heading to the right direction under Falode,” he ended.
Reigning champions Nasarawa Amazons will begin their title defence against Lagos-based outfit Robo Queens at the Lafia Township Stadium.
