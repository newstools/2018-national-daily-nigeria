Delta Sen. Ovie Omo-Agege has revealed the conspirators that orchestrated Senator Ali Ndume’s suspension for six months last year.
Omo-Agege was suspended for 90 legislative days for siding with President Muhammadu Buhari’s veto on election amendment.
The APC senator is also in the thick of a mace theft scandal last week in the upper chamber.
In a detailed Twitter post recently, the suspended senator, who was fingered as part of the ethics and privilege committee who recommended Nsume’s suspension, said he never signed the document.
He said the lawmakers that supported the suspension were of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) with the exception of one All Progressives Congress (APC) senator. Ndume is of the APC.
“A lot has been said on social media about me being part of a committee that recommended 6 months suspension for senator Ali Ndume, I have this to say; Being part of a committee does not necessarily mean one must approve whatever the report of the committee is,” he tweeted.
“For the purpose of setting the records straight, senator Ovie Omo-Agege refused to sign the report that facilitated the suspension of senator Ali Ndume.
“Available facts shows that of the 13-member committee, only seven signed the report, with six of them being members of the PDP.
“The only senator elected on the platform of the APC who signed the report was Tayo Alasoadura. Not even the Vice Chairman of the Committee, Senator Bala Na’Allah, signed the report. Ndume was elected on the platform of the APC.
“Senators elected on the platform of the PDP who signed the report were Samuel Anyanwu (Chairman), Obinna Ogba (Ebonyi), Jeremiah Useni (Plateau), Peter Nwaoboshi (Delta), Matthew Urhoghide (Edo), Mao Ohuabunwa (Abia).
“Apart from Senator Bala Na’allah, APC senators who did not sign the report were Omogunwa Yele, Muhammed Shittu, Ovie Omo-Agege and Binta Garba.”
