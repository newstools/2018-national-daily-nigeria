Edo Governor Godwin Obaseki has announced a ban on grazing after suspected herdsmen attacked some communities attacked.
Odighi and Odiguete, in the Ovia North-East Local Government Area of the state were attacked on the weekend, and that sparked off a protest staged at the government house.
Speaking during a meeting with members of the Odighi, Owan and Odigwuetue communities at the palace of the Enogie of Odighi, the governor  ordered that no razing whatsoever should take place for 90 days in the area.
According to him, the ban will enable the government to identify those lawfully allowed to graze in the areas so as to prevent further attacks.
And the in the meantime, the attackers will be hunted and arrested.
Residents of Odighi community  protesting the killing of the late Pastor Pius Eromosele by suspected herdsmen on April 2 laid the coffin of the deceased at the entrance to the Government House.
The remains of the pastor of the Church of God Mission were said to have been found decomposing in a bush during a search by hunters and vigilance group member.
A special task force, comprising various security agencies, would go round the affected communities within two weeks to get information that would help dislodge the criminals who posed as herdsmen in the forest.
He stressed the need to separate herdsmen from cattle rustlers, whom he said stole cattle, invaded farms, raped and killed people.
He assured that efforts were being made to identify the “real herdsmen” in the state.
“Before now, Fulani herdsmen were known for carrying sticks around to control their cattle. Today, some of them have become criminals,” he said.
