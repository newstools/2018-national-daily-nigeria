Award winning Nigerian musician, Wizkid may be missing his Coachella performance for the second time in a week and a lot of fans are not having it. After missing the first leg of his performance at the music festival due to visa issues surrounding his band, news have surfaced on social media that the Starboy is set to miss performing at the second leg of the event this weekend.
It had been believed that the singer had sorted the visa issues following news emanating from his camp and a tweet from Afrobeat legend, Femi Anikulapo-Kuti who he visited at the Shrine over the weekend wishing him safe journey on his flight.
However, he was reportedly sighted at different hangout spots in Lagos on Thursday night, with his performance at the festival scheduled for 2.30pm, Saturday afternoon. A source close to the pop star told Pulse that he was also seen at Quilox night club a few days ago.
Neither the organizers nor the artiste have released any official statement, concerning his performing or not. He has also refused to respond to fans asking if he will perform or not.
