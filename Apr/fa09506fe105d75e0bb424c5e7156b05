Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, former minister of finance, says former president Goodluck Jonathan, had a clear direction of where he wanted to take Nigeria to, but acknowledged that he did not know economics.
The former MD of the World Bank stated this in her recently released book on her role in the Jonathan administration, Fighting Corruption is Dangerous.
Jonathan, who studied Zoology, was always willing to support Okonjo-Iweala on matters that would improve the state of the nation’s economy, the book revealed.
Okonjo-Iweala said Jonathan agreed to the terms that she thought would enhance her goals of building on the work she started as minister under former president Obasanjo.
“He also approved of creating an economic team that he would chair that would meet regularly once a month to start and at longer intervals down the line and a smaller economic implementation team that I would chair that would meet once a week to coordinate between economic portfolios and get things done.
“I traveled to Nigeria to see the President, and my youngest brother, ChiChi, drove me to the Villa (the official office and residence of Nigerian presidents) for that definitive meeting,” she wrote.
“Arriving at the residence gate, I suddenly felt nervous about the enormity of what I might be signing on to. My brother noticed my unease and parked the car in a corner, and we prayed for God’s wisdom and guidance.
“We had a good discussion on the economy, and even though he kept saying he did not know economics, he was clear on the direction he wanted to take the country.
“We went over my terms of reference, including the role I would assume as Coordinating Minister of the Economy (CME), as he wanted it done. He agreed to a regular bilateral meeting at least once a week and accessibility at other times when it might be needed.”
