Governor Ayodele Fayose of Ekiti State mocks President Muhammadu Buhari on his revelation of intention to seek re-election for second term in 2019 on Monday. The governor stated that Nigeria does not need President Buhari as leader in 2019, remarking that the president’s declaration for reelection on Monday “is an ambition that is dead on arrival.”
Governor Fayose was of the view that if Buhari is reelected, he would kill the country.
Fayose, speaking in Ado-Ekiti through his Chief Press Secretary, Idowu Adelusi, on Monday, remarked that if Buhari was unable to read the handwriting on the wall and know when to call it quit, Nigerians would show him the exit door in 2019 by voting him out of office.
Fayose contended that Buhari is not only too old to lead the country well, he had bungled the opportunity given him by his woeful performance.
According to the governor: “That ambition is dead on arrival.
“We don’t want grandpa as president anymore.
“Nigeria does not deserve a Buhari as president in 2019.
“Buhari is old and tired.”
