A Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Festus Keyamo, has got an uphill task with his appointment as spokesperson for President Muhammadu Buhari Campaign Organisation for 2019–both at the primary and general election.

A memo signed by the director-general of the organisation, dated April 17, conveyed the appointment to the rights activist and lawyer who heads the Keyamo Chamber.

“As you are aware, President Muhammadu Buhari is seeking the nomination of our great party, the All Progressive Congress as the candidate for the said election,’ Transport Minister Rotimi Amaechi.

“Your appointment is to aid in getting that nomination and subsequent campaign for the 2019 presidential election.”

President Buhari declared last Monday his intention to seek re-election despite mounting opposition from former President Olusegun Obasanjo and others who believe age is no longer on his side.

Younger politicians in the party who intended to contest are now swarming secretly to the SDP, a party Obasanjo and his Coalition for Nigeria are working with to oust Buhari in 2019.

According to Amaechi, Keyamo, now as the spokesperson for the BCO, shoulders the responsibility to sell Buhari to the party and Nigerians in general.
