Members of the House of Representatives have massed into the Senate for a joint session following the seizure of the mace in the upper house at 11:35pm to express solidarity with the senators.
The joint session demanded Inspector General of Police Ibrahim Idris and Director-General of DSS Lawal Daura recover the stolen mace “within 24 hours.”
Deputy Speaker Yusuf Lasun, who led the Reps, stated that there would not be a democracy without a functional legislature.
The federal lawmakers have condemned the incident as an act of terrorism on an arm of government.
No fewer than 10 hefty men invaded the Senate plenary, and took away the mace.
The men were identified with suspended Sen. Ovie-Omo-Agege from Delta.
