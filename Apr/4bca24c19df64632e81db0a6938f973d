Senator Shehu Sani has been invited to appear at the Kaduna Police Command headquarters;
He was named in an audio record preceeding a murder in Kaduna.
Commissioner of Police Austin Iwar wrote a letter to the Senate inviting the senator to appear before the police on April 30.
The letter, referenced CR: 2000/KDS/VOL 5H/72 was said sent through the clerk of the National Assembly.
Senate President Bukola Saraki was also copied.
“This is in connection with a case of criminal conspiracy and culpable homicide transferred to this office by 1 Division, Nigerian Army, Kaduna, alongside with exhibit audio CD, in which your name was mentioned by the principal suspect,” the letter  read in part.
One Isa Garba arrested by the military was allegedly named Sheu after he was transferred to the police.
Sani’s name came up when Garba named another suspect, Bashir Hamdada, involved in the killing of one Lawal Madugu.
Iwar noted the case was not politically-motivated.
“A case was transferred to me and I am handling the case. The matter is currently under investigation and we don’t think we have reached a stage yet where we could inform the public about it,” he said.
But Sen. Sheu told the Cable the Kaduna State Government had concluded plans to frame him.
“They want to frame me the same way they framed Senator Dino Melaye in Kogi on allegations of arming thugs,” he said.
Sheu and Melaye (Kogi West) are among the most critical of President Muhammadu Buhari, and the most comic senators in the upper chamber.
Both have been having running battles with their state governors—Nasir el-Rufat and Yahaya Bello.
