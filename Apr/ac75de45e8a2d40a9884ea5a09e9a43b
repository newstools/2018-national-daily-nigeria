The Deputy British High Commissioner to Nigeria, Miss Laure Beaufils, has hinted the international community is watching Ekiti State,and will be interested in the conduct of the July 14guber election in the state.
The British Envoy said this  yesterday in Ado-Ekiti, when she paid a courtesy visit to the management of a private radio station, Voice 89.9 FM.
“I believe the primaries should be open. Though it will definitely be a tense period, people all over the country are looking forward to it.
“Politicians should dwell on issues, policies, and manifestos rather than on personalities. The coming Ekiti election is a signal to the 2019 general election.”
The managing director of the station, Donald Falayi, said the station has maintained neutrality in the coverage and reportage of events in the state in line with broadcasting code.
The PDP national chairman, however, has told Germany’s Ambassador Bernhard Schlagheck, the ruling party APC and INEC have colluded to rig the election.
Uche Secondud told Schlagheck who paid him a courtesy call at the party’s national secretariat, Abuja.
“The July Ekiti State governorship election will be the first test for this administration. We know that the APC and INEC have perfected plans rig the election,” said Secondus.
Both parties have been having a hard time preparing for their primaries as scores of party members declared intention to run.
