About 16 people have been reportedly killed following an early morning attack on Kpanche and two other communities in Bassa local government area of Kogi state on Sunday by unidentified gunmen.

Khalid Bukar, the traditional ruler of Mozum community in the area told National Daily that the violence has spread to Ozugbe and Biroko, two villages under his domain.

He said a number of houses in both villages were completely razed by unknown hoodlums while five persons were shot dead. The ruler said one person, whom he simply identified as Musa, was also missing.
He said those killed included the Madaki of Biroko, Mohammed Umar, and four of his subjects.

Bukar said many houses including that of the late Madaki were razed by the invaders.

The traditional ruler said he immediately informed security agents of the development but that the damage was already done before their arrival.

Meanwhile, the police said six of the bandits that invaded Kpanche earlier in the day were killed and not five as earlier announced.

William Aya, the police spokesman, said 15 houses were also burnt down in Kpanche.
He said upon receiving distress calls from residents, mobile policemen and soldiers were promptly dispatched to restore peace and order.
 
“On sighting the security personnel, they opened fire at them, but were vehemently resisted by the fire power of the security personnel where six of the attackers were killed,” he said.

Aya said Ali Janga, the commissioner of police, has ordered a thorough investigation into the unfortunate incidents.

“He vowed to prosecute anyone linked to the attacks no matter highly placed so as to serve as a deterrent to others,” he said.

Janga urged the affected residents of the affected community to remain calm as the security agencies are determined to ensure adequate security of lives and property in the state.
