A former governor of Sokoto state, Attahiru Bafarawa, has advised members of the Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP) to intensify prayers and repentance towards God.

While addressing members of the party at the PDP North-west rally on Saturday in Katsina, Bafarawa said it was the sins that the PDP members committed that God is punishing them with it.

“Almighty Allah does not make mistakes and that was the reason why when the PDP offended him, He snatched the power and handed it to APC.”

Ibrahim Dankwambo, governor of Gombe state, also spoke at the rally. He charged Nigerians to shun all forms of corrupt practices and rise up and challenge the evil of corruption in the country.

“Corruption is an evil deed that retards the progress of any nation,” he said.

On his part, Ibrahim Shema, former Katsina governor, backed calls for the restructuring of the country, saying it would result in rapid development of the nation.

He said the banking and political sectors must be restructured to encourage all citizens to be part of the Nigeria project.
Shema said Nigerians need not panic over the agitations by some well-meaning Nigerians over the restructuring project.

In his remarks, Muazu Babangida Aliyu, former governor of Niger state, advised PDP members to close ranks and work towards the success of the party in 2019.
 
Aliyu said without unity, the PDP would not clinch back the power it held for 16 years.
