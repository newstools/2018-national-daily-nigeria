Former President Olusegun Obasanjo has fired yet another shot at President Muhammadu Buhari, saying his government has failed.

Recall that in January, Obasanjo wrote a strongly-worded letter to Buhari, asking him to forget about the 2019 election.
The former President also warned Nigerians against “reinforcing failure” through re-electing ineffective and incompetent government.

The elder statesman asked the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to stop giving excuses.

He spoke on Monday at the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library, Abeokuta, Ogun state, while hosting the New Nigeria Group.
“The first lesson I learnt in my military training is to never reinforce failure. What we have now is a failure,” he said.

“Never have you reinforced failure. Let failure be failure. And if you do not see what you should see, you will then be a victim of what you don’t like because it’s only when you see what you should see and you do what you should do that you put away what you do not like.

“Those of you who are into business know that by now you would have recorded progress if not for an ineffective government.”
