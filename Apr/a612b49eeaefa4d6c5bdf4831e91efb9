President Muhammadu Buhari, on Tuesday, condemned the killing of priests and worshippers in a Church in Benue State by armed bandits.
The President in a statement in Abuja by Femi Adesina, Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, described as vile and satanic the killing of worshippers and two priests at a Catholic Church in Ukpor-Mbalom community in Gwer East Local Government Area of Benue State.
Accordingly, he extended condolence to the People and Government of the state.
President Buhari declared: “I extend my sincere condolences to the government and people of Benue State, the Mbalom Community, and especially, the Bishop, priests and members of the St Ignatius’ Catholic Church, whose premises was the unfortunate venue of the heinous killings by gunmen.
“This latest assault on innocent persons is, particularly, despicable. Violating a place of worship, killing priests and worshippers is not only vile, evil and satanic, it is clearly calculated to stoke up religious conflict and plunge our communities into endless bloodletting.”
Stressing that the country will not bow to the machinations of evildoers, President Buhari vowed that the assailants would be hunted down and made to pay for the sacrilege committed.
