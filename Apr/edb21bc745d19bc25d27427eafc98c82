President Muhammadu Buhari on Wednesday described many Nigerian youth as freeloaders who like to lazy around because their country is oil-rich.
President Buhari said this while speaking at the Commonwealth Business Forum in Westminster.
According to him, Nigeria has 180 million people, with a vibrant youth bulge made up of illiterates who love the good life.
“More than 60 percent of the population is below 30, a lot of them haven’t been to school and they are claiming that Nigeria is an oil producing country, therefore, they should sit and do nothing, and get housing, healthcare, education free,” Buhari said.
Buhari’s low blow to Nigerian youth is coming at a time when most politicians seeking to occupy Aso Rock are sweating to court the youth.
For instance, former V.P. Atiku Abubakar, a presidential aspirant, has been making a point of focusing his efforts on youth development if he wins the 2018 election.
