Sen. Shehu Sani, representing Kaduna Central, has honoured the invitation by the police in Kaduna.

According to him, he honoured the invite, wrote a statement, and was later allowed to go, based on self recognition.

The senator disclosed this on his verified Twitter handle.

“The Police invited me to appear today by 10:45am. I honored the invitation to the Police Headquarters in Kaduna by 10:45am, with clear conscience.I wrote my statements. I was granted ‘self bail’. I have left,”he tweeted.

The command had asked the senator to appear on April 30 at the state headquarters after
identifying him as a person of interest in a murder case.

Commissioner of Police Austin Iwar wrote to the NASS in that respect.

The letter, with reference number, CR: 2000/KDS/VOL 5H/72, was said to have been routed through the Clerk of the National Assembly, while the Senate President was also copied.

“This is in connection with a case of criminal conspiracy and culpable homicide transferred to this office by 1 Division, Nigerian Army, Kaduna, alongside with exhibit audio CD, in which your name was mentioned by the principal suspect,” Iwar said in the letter.

A murder suspect, Isa Garba, who was arrested by the military, was alleged to have implicated the federal lawmaker after he was transferred to the police.

Sani’s name was mentioned when the suspect, who allegedly was involved in the killing of one Lawal Madugu, implicated another person identified as Bashir Hamdada.

Iwar said the case was not politically-motivated.

Sani, however, has hinted all is the handiwork of Kaduna Gov. Nasir el-Rufai, with whom he has been having a running battle.
