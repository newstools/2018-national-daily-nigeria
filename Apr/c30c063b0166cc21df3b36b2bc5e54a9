Former Super Eagles striker, Daniel Amokachi has suggested that the coaches of the national team still need to work harder to present a solid team for the 2018 FIFA World Cup tournament in Russia.

Amokachi explained to our reporter that it was clear there were still some areas to be worked on with the team.

Daniel as an assistant coach to late coach Stepehen Keshi took the the Eagles to the second round of the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. He admitted that the Super Eagles are one of Africa’s best team going to the 2018 tournament and just like the other teams they most avoid distractions.

He  told National Daily that Super Eagles have lots of quality players and we trying to make some very good egusi soup out of that team.

“We haven’t gotten it right but we have the quality in that team. We have played and won against Argentina and we played another friendly match and it is good because now we have seen where we need to work out,”  said Amokachi while in Kenya to promote Morroco’s 2026 World Cup bid.
