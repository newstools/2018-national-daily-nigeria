The Abuja Division of the Federal High Court has issued a seven-day ultimatum to the Senate and other parties to respond to a suit challenging its investigation of Delta Central Senator Ovie Omo-Agege.
Omo-Agege was suspended during the week for 90 legislative days after he was investigated by the Senate commottee on ethics.
The committee indicted him for siding with Prsident Muhammadu Buhari on the Electoral Act amendment impasse between the executive and the legislature.
The court presided by Nnamdi Dimgba made the ruling after declaring that the time for the defence, including Senate President Bukola Saraki, to file their response to the motion brought by  Omo-Agege had been abridged.
The suspended senator is asking the court to stop the Senate from implementing the report of the Senate committee which investigated comments he made–that the Senate reordered the election to work against the president.
He actually apologised for making that comment.
But the committee still went ahead to probe him, pushing Omo-Agege to fly to lawt, seeking an order preventing the Senate from taking any action on the findings made by the committee.
Mr Omo-Agege also asked the committee to suspend its investigations pending the determination of the matter in court.
The committee has, however, submitted its findings to the Senate, which resulted in the suspension of Mr Omo-Agege on Thursday for 90 days.
