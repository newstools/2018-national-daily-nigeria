Zainab Ali-Nielsen,  popularly known as Alizee, and her four-year-old daughter, Petra, have been killed by her husband Peter Nielsen, a Danish.

Not much has been known about the circumstances surrounding the death for now.
But both were murdered in the family’s residence at Ocean Parade, Banana Island early Thursday.

Nielsen also has been arrested, and the  corpses have been deposited in a mortuary for autopsy.

Lagos State Police Public Relations Officer SP Chike Oti confirmed the arrest of the suspect for murder.

According to him,  a crime scene investigative team has been deployed in the house.

“It is pre-emptive now to ascertain the cause of the incident. The CP has dispatched crime scene investigators to the place to pick evidences for analysis which can be used for prosecution,” he said.

“The command has also written the Embassy of the suspect that the police are investigating the case.”

Alizee, a native of Kogi, recently hit a gold mine when she signed a two-year record deal with an Asian record label, Petra Entertainment in 2017.

She thereafter bought a brand new Ford Explorer, a house on Banana Island. She also signed international distribution with affiliates of her record company in Asia.
