Governor David Umahi has ordered for the arrest of a policeman who killed a motorcyclist for refusing to give him N50 bribe.

The killing of the motorcyclist along Water Works road, Anan in the state triggered rage in residents around the area who almost killed the culprit if not for the intervention of some policemen who saved the day.

Speaking through his Chief Press Secretary, Emmanuel Uzor, Umahi referred to the development as ‘barbaric and callous’ and stating that he is certain justice will be served in the.

The victim, whose identity is still unknown was said to have been accosted by men of the anti-kidnapping squad of the state’s police command at Anan world junction by the said road.

A firsthand eyewitness of the incident told newsmen that the ‘okada’ rider in his 20s was carrying a female passenger when he was flagged down by the police officers, who are notorious for extracting money from vehicle owners at the night along the junction.

 “When they stopped him, they demanded for their usual N50 but he gave them N20 and wanted to drive off when one of them opened fire on him. The bullet shattered his head and he died instantly,” the witness had said.

It was also gathered that residents and other okada riders used bonfires to block the road in protest of the killing.

 The witness, however, said that the arrival of a fresh detachment of policemen to the scene took over the situation, using teargas to dispel the crowd and shooting into the air to set them to their heels.

Although the police spokesman in the state, Loveth Odah is yet to issue any statement on the matter, the state government has assured the people that the suspect would be brought to book.
