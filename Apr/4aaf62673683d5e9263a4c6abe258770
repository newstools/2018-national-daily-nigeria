SDP’s chairman and former SGF Olu Falae has explained the purpose of his visit to former President Olusegun Obasanjo in Abeokuta Tuesday.
According to him, he came visiting Obasanjo for the first time in 19 years to discuss Nigeria’s affairs.
The meeting lasted for two hours behind closed doors at the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library, Abeokuta, at exactly 2.25pm.
Falae described Obasanjo as his former boss, and emphasised that the affairs of Nigeria are greater than anybody’s political ambition.
“I am here to visit Papa Olusegun Obasanjo, former head of military government and former President of Nigeria who was my boss when I was the permanent secretary at the presidency,” he said.
“The affairs of Nigeria are greater than the political ambition of anybody. So I came here to exchange views with Baba.”
The two have been on the trot since President Muhammadu Buhari declared his intention to contest in 2019, against Obasanjo’s advce and opposition.
In the deepening conspiracy against the ruling APC, Obasanjo and Falae, both former political enemies, are joining forces to dislodge Buhari come 2019.
Obasanjo’s Coalition for Nigeria Movement, a non-partisan platform, will be working with Falae’s SDP to produce the third force Obasanjo’s boasted of in his 13-page open letter he fired at Buhari months ago.
