Voters are yet to start coming out for verification in the recall of Kogi West Sen. Dino Melaye INEC scheduled for Saturday in Lokoja.
There is also a low turnout of the constituents that moved for the recall of the senator last year.
The exercise, scheduled to start at 8 am, didn’t kick off at Lokongoma/Phase 1 where INEC’s officials were still pasting the voter’s list as at 10.00 am.
A similar experience marked the exercise at unit 001, Open Mammy Market, opposite Chari Meigumeri Barracks also in Lokoja.
INEC’s officer on duty said some voters came to check their names, and then returned home.
