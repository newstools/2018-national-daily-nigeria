All is not well as the Super Falcons were shortchanged by the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), reports Futbalgalore.com.
Insiders confirmed to Futbalaglore.com that the NFF were paid €40,000 as appearance fee for the game between France and Nigeria.
The French side walloped the reigning African Women’s Cup of Nations (AWCON) champions 8-0 at the Stade MM Arena on Friday night.
Following a minor disagreement between the players and the NFF officials on ground, each player of the Falcons were paid $100 and told to drop their account numbers.
This decision irked senior members of the team as they went back to their respective clubs vividly disappointed at the non-challant attitude of the NFF to women’s football in Nigeria.
This is not the first time that the football body and the Falcons will have issues over monies in the last two years, with the AWCON 2016 protest debacle still fresh.
It was also gathered that NFF President Melvin Pinnick Amaju insisted that the AWCON 2016 protest rebels apologise before they could be invited for national team duties but the ladies refused and claimed they fought for their rights.
Super Falcons head coach Thomas Dennerby insisted on the senior players and specifically told the NFF supremo that they are central to his plans.
