Top bankers in the country, serving senators and former governors are said to be jittering following strong indications that the federal government may be compiling fresh names of people alleged to have looted the nation’s treasury.

Their fears, National Daily gathered, were based on the new facts that the new list being compiled may include names of top bankers and politicians who have not been arraigned in court in the past.

Although no specific bank CEOs have been mentioned, a source close to the Presidency, who spoke on condition of anonymity, at the weekend, confirmed the new list, noting the new list would shock many Nigerians because of the caliber of people involved.

The source said: “Between you and me, I can authoritatively tell you that we are compiling a fresh list. We won’t release it until we are satisfied with it. We want to be thorough. People will be shocked when we release the fresh names.

“Those who accused us of being biased will know that we know what we are doing. The first list was a fraction. When the second one came out, people were surprised. As for the next one, people will be shocked. I won’t say more than that.”

Recall that the federal government of Nigeria, last week released a list of alleged looters after the Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP) asked Nigerians for forgiveness.

The minister of information and culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, had earlier said 55 persons looted N1.4trn under the administration of Goodluck Jonathan, he, however, only released 29 names out of the 55.

Most of the names on the previous two lists released by the government are those already undergoing trial for alleged corruption while the names of members of the former ruling party, the Peoples’ Democratic Party, who had defected to the ruling All Progressives Congress were conspicuously omitted from the list.
