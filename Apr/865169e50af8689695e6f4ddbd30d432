A businessman and associate of Atiku Abubakar, Alhaji Abdullahi Sugar, says Atiku’s nationwide appeal will enable him defeat Buhari not minding the incumbency factor.

He states that if the former vice president gets the PDP ticket, he would send the president out of the presidential villa, back to Daura come February 2019 through popular votes.

“We thank God that Buhari has declared his intention to contest again in 2019. By so doing he has lessened the task for Atiku. If given the PDP ticket, Atiku will shock Buhari.

“We are urging Nigerians to be calm pending the time when Atiku will come on board. He would wipe away the tears of Nigerians. The masses spent their money, time and resources to bring Buhari to power, but now they have been paid back with abject poverty,” he stated.

Atiku, a former leader in the ruling All Progressives Party (APC), said he decided not to wait and participate in the APC primary election because the party had become a one-man business.

He said since President Muhammadu Buhari came into power, he failed to take charge of the growth of the party.
Atiku said to be in the UK, is talking to international opinion leaders as he prepares to officially announce his intention to run for President under the Peoples’ Democratic Party’s platform.

Atiku, according to his associates, would immediately conclude his consultations with the major stakeholders in the party and thereafter formally launch his bid for the PDP presidential ticket.
