Popular founder of one of the major sponsors of the Big brother Naija show, Eyo Bassey, the C.E.O of Payporte, has taken to social media to reiterate that sex does not sell in Nigeria. The founder of the online store and largest e- commerce company in Nigeria, took to Instagram to say this:  I hope everyone will understand and see clearly that “sex” and nudity doesn’t sell on #BBNaija… @PayPorte has maintained this position. Compared to last season when neither sex nor nudity was televised we all can judge. I hope my fellow colleagues can get the message.

The first season of the show first aired on DStv Channel 37 from March 5 to June 4, 2006. The voting results are verified by the auditing company of Alexander-Forbes.
The first season of the show first aired on DStv Channel 37 from March 5 to June 4, 2006. In a twist to the game, two new contestants were introduced on Day 23, much to the excitement of the remaining house mates.
Ebuka, the most popular house mate for several weeks into the show and widely believed to emerge winner was the seventh house mate to be evicted; many viewers blame the Joe’s Fan Club (JFC) for his eviction. Joe himself was soon evicted from the show.
Big Brother added another twist to the game on day 79 by cancelling the day’s scheduled nominations and making the house mates believe they will instead be evicted based on their performances on assigned tasks while in reality no more evictions were held and viewers began voting for the winner who turned out to be 26-year-old Katung Aduwak.
