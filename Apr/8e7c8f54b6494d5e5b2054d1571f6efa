Cristiano Ronaldo’s remarkable scoring run may have come to a close on Wednesday, but he still managed to set another Champions League record.

With Real Madrid’s 2-1 win over Bayern Munich, Ronaldo has now won more Champions League games than any other player with 96, passing Madrid goalkeeping great Iker Casillas.

Marcelo and Marco Asensio took care of the scoring duties for Madrid, who took a big step toward the final with the win in the semi-final first leg.

Zinedine Zidane’s side also set a team record in the competition with the victory in Munich.
The two-time defending champions won their 150th Champions League game, becoming the first side to reach the mark.
