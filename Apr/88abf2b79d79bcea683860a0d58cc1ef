Popular late actor, Adeyemi Afolayan, popularly known as Ade Love, was a famous filmmaker in Nigeria. So, it came as a shock when one of his sons, Aremu Afolayan, stated that his father lived a very poor life despite his fame.
However, Ade Love’s most popular son, Kunle Afolayan, has rubbished Aremu’s claims, insisting that their father did not die a poor man.
In his words, “Do you know Ade Love? Was Ade Love a poor man? That is his (Aremu’s) own opinion as everyone has a mind of their own. I would not say things were rosy, but we were never poor. If your parents were able to give you quality education and you enjoyed some luxuries that a lot of people didn’t have access to, then you cannot openly say you come from a poor home.”
He stressed that during the lifetime of his late father, he was the biggest filmmaker in Nigeria and he was always busy working on projects. He said, “I am sure I didn’t come from a poor home. Though I cannot speak for anyone, I just think he (Aremu) is stupid. I didn’t get to see the story. Funnily, some people thought I was the one who granted the interview. When the General Manager of Eko Hotel told me he read my interview in SUNDAY PUNCH, I was surprised because I didn’t grant any interview recently. Whenever I see the man again, I will let him know it was not me he read; it is a misrepresentation.”
