Some governors of the All Progressives Congress (APC) are currently meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari at the presidential villa in Abuja.

Top on the agenda of the meeting is Buhari’s opposition to the elongation of the tenure of the party’s national working committee led by John Oyegun, which some of the governors described as a coup.

The meeting started at 2:15 pm, with opening prayers from Simon Lalong of Plateau state and Atiku Bagudu, his Kebbi counterpart.

Before Buhari made his way into the venue of the meeting, most the governors’ encircled Rochas Okorocha, chairman of APC Governors’ Forum, expressing reservation with the move to stop Oyegun from leading the party into the next general election.

“This is a coup and we will not allow it to stand,” one of the governors said in anger.

Buhari had asked the party leaders to prepare for congress, saying the extension of the executives at the state and national level was against the constitution of the country and the APC.

Responding to this Bola Tinubu, a national leader of the APC, said Buhari had saved the ruling party from a serious legal turmoil.

There were reports that the president withdrew support for the extension of Oyegun’s tenure in order to please Tinubu.

The party leader had demanded the removal of Oyegun following the crisis which ensued after the primary election in Ondo state.

After Buhari appointed him to reconcile aggrieved members of the party, Tinubu accused Oyegun of sabotaging his assignment.
