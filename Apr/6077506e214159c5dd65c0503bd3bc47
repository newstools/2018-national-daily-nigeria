Senator Andy Uba may be in again for another debt scandal following the leak of a document which revealed his inability to pay $35,448.55 for water and power bill in the US.

Global Integrity Crusade Network (GICN) who revealed this in a statement said Andy Uba became indebted to LADWP in the sum of $35,448.55 from March 26, 2002 through November 23, 2016 down to February 2, 2018 when he agreed to settle his indebtedness out of court pursuant to a document tagged ‘Stipulated Settlement’.

In the statement signed by the group’s Advocacy Officer, Comrade Augustine Akan Eneji, it alleges City of Los Angeles through the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) provided water and power to Andy Uba for three separate account numbers 6594661000, 7594661000 and 8594661000, opened on March 25, 2002, April 11, 2013 and May 17, 2013 at 7014 LaTijera Boulevard, Westchester, CA90045 apartment.

The group said on December 20, 2016, LADWP filed an Unlimited Civil Case with number BC644243 assigned to the Honourable Rita Miller sitting at Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles.

It was ordered that the summons be served upon AndyUba by publication thereof in The Metropolitan News, being a newspaper of general circulation at Los Angeles.

It however added that “Based on the terms of the Stipulated Settlement, Andy Uba agreed to pay his accumulated unpaid water and power bills in two tranches of $3,762.65 on February 1, 2018 and $25,221.06 on before April 30, 2018, failing which judgment shall been there and enforced against him in addition to his payment of late charges in the sum of $6,464.84.”

GICN stated that it is embarrassing that a serving Senator of the Republic of Nigeria would stoop so low to the extent of not being able to pay common water and power bills, saying that United States of America U.S.A is a sane environment where corrupt and criminally minded individuals have no hiding place.

Recall that the Senator was recently involved in a certificate forgery and unpaid professional fees running into 1.9 million Pounds with one Victor Osita Uwajeh.

The Group submitted that it has also found out that there are allegations of blackmail and serial attempts to extort money peddled by Andy Uba against Evangelist Uwajeh in a petition to the Inspector General of Police on red alert in their relationship with him.





It also alleged that Andy Uba engaged the services of one Doreen Gadegbeku Uba to act as his Agent Videa Special Power of Attorney dated June 21, 2012 and signed before Ahmed Tijani Uwais (Notary Public of Nigeria).
