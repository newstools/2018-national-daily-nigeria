Nigeria’s tier one bank, Access bank Plc have announced to its customers that withdrawal from automated teller machines (ATM) abroad has been increased from a daily limit of $100 to $300.

The bank in a mail to customers said; “We are pleased to inform you that you can now withdraw $300 daily from ATMs anywhere in the world using your Naira debit card at a competitive transaction rate”.

“The cumulative international spend limit on your card remains $5,000 monthly. Please request for a USD debit card to enjoy unlimited international spend”.

However, transaction on international POS and online remains $5,000 monthly cumulative limit.

The changes can be attributed to the seeming stabilizing foreign exchange market which plummeted in 2016 following dollar scarcity in the country.
