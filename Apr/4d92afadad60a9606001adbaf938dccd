House of Representatives has mandated its committee on Federal Road Safety Commission to investigate the high cost, delay and lack of due process in the issuance of drivers’ licenses in the country.
The House resolution followed a motion sponsored by Honourable Johnson Oguma on the need to investigate the matter.
While debating the motion, Honourable Oguma revealed that Nigerians are charged N18,000 for a two-year licence and N25,000  for a five-year licence even as the approved rate by the Joint Task Force for driver’s license is N6350 for a two-year license and N10,000 for a five-year license.
He also expressed worry that the process of acquiring driver’s license is becoming too cumbersome, as it takes about 90 to 180 days to process adding that first-time applicants are issued the license without undergoing the mandatory tests.
According to him, due to the excessive charges and delay in the release of driver’s license, prospective drivers result to self-help by driving without due documents and in some cases resort to forging the licenses which may at the long run expose road users to unqualified drivers and loss of revenue to the government.
The House, therefore, agreed to ensure that driver’s license is processed at the official rates and within the shortest period of time and urged that proper training and tests are carried out for first-time applicants.
The committee on Federal Road Safety Commission saddled with these responsibilities is expected to report its findings within eight weeks for further legislative action.
