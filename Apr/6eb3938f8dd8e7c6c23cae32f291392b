Jose Mourinho claims it would ‘not be fair’ to say Manchester City won the title because Manchester United lost, after Sunday’s shock defeat to West Brom.
Jay Rodriguez struck the games only goal in the second half, and the Baggies held out for their first away victory since August.
Defeat for the Red Devils meant Man City were crowned the Premier League champions.
“We were masters in complication, everything was complicated,” Mourinho told Sky Sports.
“We didn’t want or played simple, everything was slow, one more flick, trick, turn. There was no fluidity. We did not deserve to lose, we gave them opportunity to win the match.”
The Portuguese manager believes his side became complacent after their superb comeback win against Man City last weekend.
“I won eight titles and I am not on the moon because I won against Manchester City.
“I saw lots of people in the moon because we won against City. You could see the difference in the attitude to players compared to last week.”
“We deserve to be punished, but the defeat was too heavy.”
There was praise for Pep Guardiola and his City side from Mourinho, who didn’t want to take anything away from the blue side of Manchester after their commanding season.
“I have won titles, I would not be happy if someone say won title if someone lose a match.
“City won the title because they won more points than everyone else, not tell City they won title because United did not win, it is not fair on them.”
