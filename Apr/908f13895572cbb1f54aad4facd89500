Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Javier Pastore has admitted that he is ‘still unsure’ whether he will be leaving the newly-crowned Ligue 1 champions at the end of the season.

PSG reclaimed the French title with a thumping 7-1 win over the reigning champions Monaco on Sunday night.

Pastore started and finished the clash in Paris, but the Argentine has struggled for regular action throughout the season, and has been strongly linked with a move away from the French giants.

The 28-year-old has said that he will look to “end the season well” before addressing his future.

“This season is more beautiful because we lost the title last time out,” Pastore told Premium Sport. “This season we’ve had a great campaign. We beat Monaco 7-1 and this win gives us strength to end the season well.

“We knew that we’d have been crowned champions if we won. We needed to make it happen and we had a great match. The result is what it is, but Monaco are still a great team. What I’ll do this summer? I still don’t know.

“I want to end the season well. We have another cup to win and we’ll give it our all. As for after that, we’ll see…”

Pastore has scored four times in 11 Ligue 1 starts for PSG this season.
