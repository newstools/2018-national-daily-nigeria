Nigeria Football Federation President Amaju Kelvin Pinnick admitted that the Nigeria football governing body concentrates and focuses fully  on the Super Eagles at the expense of other national teams which confirms what  people in other quarters  christen the NFF as Nigeria Football Federation of Super Eagles.

National Daily learnt that Nigeria  U-17 female national team was knocked out by Cameroon because the camp was opened ten days to the qualifiers, hence they struggled in their games due to lack of adequate preparation.



 
In recent past, the U-20 national female team players and officials that qualified for world cup have not been paid their allowances. The players and officials are now beggars months after representing their country.
Pinnick  apologised that the decision was unintentional and beyond NFF control, cited lack of funds as one of the reasons.
He promised to always support  other national teams especially the Super Falcons.
