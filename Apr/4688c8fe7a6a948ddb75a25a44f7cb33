Bassa Kwomu and Igala communities battled each other weekend over a  disputed cashew plantation.
No fewer than five people died and  over 50 houses razed at Aloko-Oguma in Bassa Local Government Area of Kogi State when the dust settled.
The Igala claimed the Bassa Kwomu had earlier killed one of their members and buried him secretly without a trace of the grave.
This led to a reprisal on Friday when five persons were killed on the Bassa Kwomu side, with 50 houses burnt and property worth millions of naira destroyed.
The Igala, yesterday, deserted the community for fear of another attack by the Bassa Kwomu.
Soldiers and policemen have been drafted to the community to prevent further clashes.
The two have always been at daggers drawn, and the cashew plantation dispute just helped spark off the attacks.
Sole Administrator of the Local Government, Samuel Alumka, and the member representing the area in the state House of Assembly, Sunday Shigaba, have appealed to the warring communities to let peace reign.
