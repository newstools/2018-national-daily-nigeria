Benue’s  Governor Samuel Ortom has urged the Internally Displaced Persons to head back home and defend themselves with what they have: stones.
“David in the Bible used ordinary stone to defeat his enemy,” he said on Tuesday during his visit to  the IDPs.
“It is now time for you to stay at home and use the stone in your homes to defend yourself instead of running away.”
Hundreds of people left their homes after armed herdsmen attacked Naka, Gwer West Local Government Area of Benue.
He said the advice became necessary following his inability to keep the IDPs in camp any longer as the violence by herdsmen keep escalating.
“I believe in the rule of law, equity and fairness, but I cannot continue to keep IDPs and l can’t afford to have another IDPs in Gwer West,”he said.
“When we allow laws to be violated and nobody takes action, it then allows for impunity and when you give room to impunity, it will result to anarchy which will in turn breed a lawless society.”
He urged the people to rise up and support the security agencies by providing lawful and necessary logistics such as information, equipment and financial support to back up their operations.
Accordihng to him, security agents are not spared in the violence as a soldier was killed by the attackers on Monday in addition to the murder of 24 people by Fulani herdsmen.
“Time has come if you are willing to live in Benue State, you must be ready and willing to be law abiding.”
Ortom said the state government is working with traditional rulers and  other necessary organs of government to strengthen the vigilante  team so it can assist the security personnel.
