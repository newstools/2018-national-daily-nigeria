Former president Atiku Abubakar has said that President Muhammadu Buhari belongs to the prison, following an illegal payment of $496mn to the U.S government for purchase of Tucano jets.
Atiku said there was no difference in the crime Buhari had committed with that of the former National Security Adviser, Col. Sambo Dasuki, retd.
He disclosed this on his official tweeter page this morning, adding that the court should take note of the president’s illegal action.
According to him: “I think @MBuhari should go and join Dasuki at Kuje prison because both have committed the same crime. …#ilegal withdrawal.
So court should take note.”
Recall that the Nigerian lawmakers also blatantly lashed the President Buhari over the payment of $496mn for purchase of Tucano jets without the approval of the National Assembly.
Lawmakers described Buhari’s act as a breach of constitution and called for his impeachment.
The president had said he took the action because the US gave Nigeria a deadline for payment. He also sought to include the procurement of the aircraft in the 2018 budget.
