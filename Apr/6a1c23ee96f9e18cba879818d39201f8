The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has said that the All Progressives Congress (APC) is passing through death throes and pre-election trauma.
PDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, in a statement on Wednesday, contended that the confusion, backstabbing and vicious scheming in the ruling party shows that APC has become politically decapitated.
PDP further bemoaned that the APC is an “ideologically empty movement” put together for the purpose of winning political power and not for the good of Nigerians.
The Opposition Party urged Nigerians not o be deceived by the APC decoy.
The statement read in part: “The APC is stewing in its own venomous broth. The nation can now see why, even with a sitting President, the party is still finding it difficult to agree on simple issues, but always attempt to circumvent and violate the laws to push desperate agenda of their selfish leaders.
“We call on Nigerians not to be deceived by the sudden law-abiding stance of the APC, as it is merely cosmetic and meant to cloak their hidden but soon to be manifested plots to manipulate the laws to push a self-succession plan of their incompetent candidate.”
PDP also stated that APC has never had anything to offer Nigerians other than confusion, and disagreements.
It appealed to Nigerians to remain alert and wary of all activities of some “power mongers” whom it claimed are afraid of elections.
The PDP, therefore, promised to ensure a level playing ground for all Nigerians to aspire for any position, without hindrances or manipulations.
