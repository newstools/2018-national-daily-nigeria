The post-mortem examination conducted on the late Nigerian singer, Zainab Nielsen, aka, Alizee, has revealed she died from trauma.
Lagos  CP Imohimi Edgal said the trauma resulted from the injuries inflicted on her head.
Zainab and her three-year-old daughter, Petra, were allegedly murdered on April 5 by the singer’s Danish husband, Peter Nielsen, in their residence at Bellasta Towers, Banana Island, Ikoyi.
Police prosecutor Effiong Asuquo told the court, while tendering a remand application, that Peter, 53, hit his wife’s head on the wall.
Nielsen then poisoned their daughter, and dragged their bodies to the kitchen.
He has been remanded in Ikoyi prisons while the case file was forwarded to the Directorate of Public Prosecutions for legal advice.
Speaking to journalists on the case on Monday, Edgal said the autopsy on Zainab’s corpse and forensic report gathered from the scene of crime had revealed more.
“The autospy report revealed that Mrs. Zainab Nielsen suffered trauma as a result of the impact on her head,” he said.
“Secondly, the forensic experts revealed that there were bloodstains from the couple’s bedroom to the kitchen.
“Even though they were cleverly wiped from the floor, they were still able to detect the stains with the application of special chemical reagents.
“In addition, bloodstains were also discovered on the wash hand basins and on the hand towel the suspect used in wiping his hands after the commission of the offence.
“Although it was cleverly cleaned up as well, the experts were able to discover that too.”
