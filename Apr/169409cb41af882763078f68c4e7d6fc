Commiserates with the Catholic Church, Government and People of Benue State




The National Leadership of Labour Party (LP) commiserates with the Catholic Church, People and Government of Benue State over the slaughter of two Reverend Fathers, a Catechist and 14 others, in Ayer Mbalom, Gwer East Local Government Area of Benue State by herdsmen.
The party in a Statement by the National Chairman, Alhaji Abdulkadir Abdulsalam, condemned the continued killings of Nigerians across the Federation, expressing worries over the inaction of law enforcement agencies at stopping the carnage.
“The number of killings reported daily in the media can only happen in a country where there is complete breakdown of law and order or where there is no government.
“We are baffled and worried over the inaction of Government, especially, law enforcement agencies, aimed at abating the carnage of Nigerians across the nation.
“We, hereby, remind Mr. President, Commander-In-Chief of the Armed Forces that the principal purpose of Government is to protect lives and property,” the chairman declared.
Abdulsalam stated that a time will come when citizens will rise to defend themselves by taking up arms since they are not protected by the state.
The statement further called on the Government to evolve proactive and pragmatic measures to abate the killings.
Labour Party enjoined the Government to confront poverty, hunger and unemployment since they are bye product of violent crimes and criminality.
“Consequently; we enjoined Government to evolve a pragmatic and proactive approach to the killings. It is, however, our belief that Government must confront the issues of hunger, poverty and unemployment as they are bye product of violent crimes and criminality, Abdulkadir Abdulsalam declared.
