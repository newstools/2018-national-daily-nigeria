Governor Abdullahi Ganduje who inaugurated the committee in Kano said the centre was to immortalise the late elder statesman for his immense contributions to political and democratic developments in the country.
“The center will also be utilised for research and scholarly discourse for the advancement of politics and democratic governance,” he said.

The governor mandated the committee to within eight weeks “analyse function and long term programmes of the center, to determine appropriate name and location for the center and provide appropriate frame work among others.”
