The Police have insisted on taking Dino Melaye, Senator representing Kogi West to a Kogi state court for trial shortly after he was rearrested at Zankli Medical Center in Abuja on Tuesday afternoon.
The embattled senator had earlier been arrested by the police but attempted to escape.
The statement issued by Jimoh Moshood, police spokesman, read: “At about 12pm of today (Tuesday), Sen. Dino Melaye while in lawful custody of the Nigeria police force and being taken for arraignment in federal high court, Lokoja from Abuja, escaped from lawful custody when hoodlums and miscreants in two Toyota hilux vehicles blocked the police vehicle conveying Dino Senator Melaye around Area 1 roundabout, Abuja and in the process the senator jumped out of the police vehicle through the window and was rescued from the police men by hoodlums and miscreants to an unknown destination.
“The police team re-enforced and trailed Senator Dino Melaye to Zankli Hospital, Abuja where he was re-arrested. The senator would be arraigned in court without further delay.
“Meanwhile, one of the Toyota hilux vehicles used by the hoodlums and miscreants in aiding the escape of the senator has been recovered by the police investigation team. The inspector general of police has therefore directed a thorough investigation into the circumstances leading to the rescue and escape of Senator Dino Melaye from lawful custody.”
As of the time this report was filed, the police had not taken the senator away from the hospital because he was still being treated.
