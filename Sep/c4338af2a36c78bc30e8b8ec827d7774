Chelsea failed to maintain their winning streak against West Ham at the weekend because they did not use the ball quickly enough, David Luiz has argued.
Maurizio Sarri’s men left Liverpool as the sole remaining Premier League side with a 100 per cent record due to a scoreless draw at West Ham, after the Reds had previously overcome Southampton at home.
The Stamford Bridge side are now two points adrift of the league leaders, but Luiz is still confident in what is being implemented by the former Napoli boss.
“Of course we are disappointed,” the Brazil international told his club’s official website. “We didn’t play a fantastic game, we didn’t create a lot. It was too slow, moving the ball to create the gaps or our movements without the ball, and that is why we couldn’t score.
“I think our plan is fantastic. On Sunday we didn’t play at our high level so that is why we didn’t win.
“We know that many teams now are going to play against us this way, with a low block and trying to play on the counter-attack, so there was not a lot of space but it is up to us to try to find a solution.”
On Saturday, Chelsea will have the opportunity to leapfrog Jurgen Klopp’s side as they meet in the Premier League – an occasion the 31-year-old defender is looking forward to, though only after a midweek dress rehearsal against the Reds in the Carabao Cup.
“The best games are like that,” he said. “We are going to play against a fantastic team so we need to rest and be ready for both games.”
The weekend’s slip up was the first time since Sarri took charge that Chelsea have failed to win a competitive match, having also defeated PAOK 1-0 in the Europa League.
Following their double header against Liverpool, Chelsea will tackle Videoton in Europe and will then go to Southampton in the league before the second international break of the season.
