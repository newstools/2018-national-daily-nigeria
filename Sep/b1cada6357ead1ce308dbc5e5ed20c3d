The Sunday, September 30, 2018, primary election to nominate governorship candidates for the 2019 general elections has set the All Progressives Congress, APC, on war across the 36 states of the Federation. In Nasarawa State, Governor Tanko Al-Makura has blocked every political space to frustrate Senator Abdullah Adamu, former governor of the state, from imposing a governorship candidate on the APC in the state.
Senator Adamu has been assuming the godfather of Nasarawa State politics and forcing his way to dictate who gets whatever political opportunity in the state. Adamu, National Daily gathered had approached Governor Al-Makura to endorse a governorship aspirant he is sponsoring for the 2019 governorship election on the APC ticket. Adamu had taken up the responsibility of appointing the successor to Al-Makurta, claiming the leadership of APC in Nasarawa State.
Governor Al-Makura, however, rebuffed the Senator, cautioning him to desist from imposing his successor inn 2019. Al-Makura had warned the senator that he never appointed a successor when he was governor of the state; admonishing him to desist from imposing a successor on him.
Governor Al-Makura had threatened to investigate certain activities during the administration of Adamu in the governance of the state. The threat sent the senator panicking.
Al-Makura had insisted on sponsoring his own successor as the incumbent Governor of Nasarawa State whose tenure would be ending in 2019.
The governor has his political root in the Congress of Progressives Change, CPC, a major legacy political party that formed the APC, while Adamu is of the PDP coopted political leaning. Apparently, imposing a governorship candidate would imply power shift to the PDP bloc in the APC in Nasarawa State. Al-Makura has resisted such change of guard which would be demonstrated on Sunday.
