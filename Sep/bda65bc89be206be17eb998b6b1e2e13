Ter Stegen 6 – The result indicates a comfortable game for the German but he hat to intervene to help Barca when they were only 1-0 up.
Sergi Roberto 6 – Started the game looking to get forward but soon saw he could not do that so much thanks to the PSV attackers. Was more prudent in the second half, staying in position in defence.
Gerard Pique 8 – The best Barcelona defender, helped his team-mates with good positioning, although he suffered on some PSV counter-attacks.
Samuel Umtiti 4 – Arrived late to some balls and committed more fouls than he usually would. Booked for complaining and then sent off for a clear block on a counter attack.
Jordi Alba 7 – The left flank started with him, continued in Coutinho and finished in Dembele. He looked fresh and joined the attack well. Lozano gave him a headache or two but Barca kept their clean sheet.
Sergio Busquets 7 – In the first half he brought balance and patience against PSV’s counter-attacks. In the second he moved the team from right to left and back, circulating the ball well.
Ivan Rakitic 7 – Covered a lot of ground, adding in attack without forgetting his defensive tasks. Worked tirelessly to recover the ball.
Philippe Coutinho 7 – Naturally elegant, the Brazilian showed his enormous quality. Didn’t score but came close with a couple of efforts and the fans appreciated his work and delicate contributions.
Lionel Messi 9 – Didn’t appear in the opening stages but then scored a brilliant free-kick, and added two more with exquisite finishes. He’s started the Champions League as he means to go on.
Ousmane Dembele 9 – Inspired, energetic and brave at the start of the season, and this was another great game. Took advantage of the space with his speed, took on rivals with no fear, and scored a brilliant goal after a sick turn.
Luis Suarez 7 – Did not score but worked hard without rest, making space and carving out chances. Hit the bar with a nice lob.
