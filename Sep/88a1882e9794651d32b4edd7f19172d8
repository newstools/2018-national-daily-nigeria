The Federal Operations Unit Zone ‘C’, an anti-smuggling arm of the Nigeria Customs Service Owerri, has intercepted a truck with military hardware and medicaments concealed within it.
National Daily authoritatively gathered that the FOU mobile patrol team on the Head bridge recently, effected the interception, uncovering prohibited items which included 90 pairs of military camouflage uniform, 97 pieces of military camouflage jungle hats and 202 pieces of military camouflage round neck vest.
Expatiating on this, the FOU Owerri Controller, Olusemire Kayode gave newsmen a breakdown showing 20 pieces of military camouflage singlet; 40 pieces of military camouflage jungle boots; 10 pieces of military camouflage water bags; two rolls of plain military khaki material; 7 cartons of 402 packs of hydrochloride Royal tramadol containing 10x10x10 tablets made in India; four cartons of 60 packs of made in India Tramadol injection; three cartons of 140 packs of CSP with codeine cough syrup made in UK; 100 packs of Diazepam made in India; two cartons of 231 packs of Juhel D5 tablets and one carton of 100 packs of Pankizol.
Other items also intercepted were 10 cartons of new flipchart board, 51 cartons of lion school chalk, and one carton of file.
Comptroller Olusemire highlighted that the seizure was made following a tip off from informants and urged the public to emulate such patriotism and forward valuable information to the Service, adding that two suspects were presently in custody, even as thorough investigation is ongoing.
He praised the doggedness and preparedness of officers and affirmed that the Unit under his watch will nip the affairs of smugglers in the bud.
Speaking further, he queried the aim of the importers of the consignment in concealing the military hardware and medicament explaining that the improper importation of the camouflage and medicament pose grave health and safety risks.
The FOU Command Boss consequently admonished smugglers to engage in legitimate trade and called for public support in the fight against smuggling.
It would be recalled that the FOU Zone ‘C’ Owerri had similarly made a seizure of military hardware earlier in July.
