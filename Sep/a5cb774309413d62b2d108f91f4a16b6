Pick PDP nomination form




At last, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Right Honourable Yakubu Dogara may have dumped the All Progressives Congress, APC. Though the Speaker is yet to make formal declaration on the reported defection, he was revealed to have picked the nomination form of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, for the 2019 election into the House of Representatives of the National Assembly.
National Daily gathered that the Speaker bought the PDP expression of interest and nomination forms for the House of Representatives by proxy.
A source at the PDP Secretariat, Abuja, was gathered to have revealed that some individuals under unidentified group purchased the nomination forms on behalf of the House of Representatives Speaker.
The Speaker is expected to formally declare his defection from the APC to the PDP when the National Assembly reconvenes on September 25, 2019, after the long recess.
National Daily had earlier this week reported that the Speaker is set to dump the ruling APC for the PDP. Our earlier report last Monday further revealed that some other lawmakers in the Lower Chamber of the national Assembly may join the exodus to the PDP and that the defections were to be done before the primary elections of candidates for the 2019 elections by the respective political parties.
Dogara is expected to complete the exit of Reformed All Progressives Congress, RAPC, from the ruling APC to the PDP in the same manner that former Speaker of the House, Aminu Tambuwal, current Governor of Sokoto State, coordinated similar action in the buildup to the 2015 general elections when the team from the PDP defected in mass to the APC.
