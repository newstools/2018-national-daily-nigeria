Vicente del Bosque spoke to the Olympic Channel about Usain Bolt’s new adventure as a soccer player, after making his debut on August 31st in the first division of Australian football, predicting that he could make a career with the band in a team with spaces.
“For a team that plays kickback, with fast transitions, I surely he can be a good player, with spaces he could be a good player,” he explained. His place would be attached to the line of lime: “A side with a lot of travel, with the back giving the public, in the band, there would be more useful.”
“But not only is running a hundred, sixty or seventy meters of a field, but to do it many times, and that requires resistance, I do not know if he’s prepared for that, although I’m sure he does,” said the former national adaptation of a Jamaican sprinter to football.
In addition, he added that his attitude seems to be very good for the images that have been seen so far by Bolt with the Central Coast Mariners shirt: “Yes it is true that in the videos you see a very optimistic, nice player. the time laughing, it seems as if he is living the dream of any child. “
