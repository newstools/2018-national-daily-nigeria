The voters of the survey proposed this past Monday by As , ‘Who do you think the Best will win the best player of 2018?’, Invite Cristiano to find a restaurant, choose between the options offered by the card or invent any other plan that replace the FIFA gala on September 24: following the trend of what happened in the award of the UEFA Best Player Award, 82.21% fans see Luka Modric as the next The Best.
At the ceremony on August 30, Cristiano, who as his coach confessed was disgusted by the final verdict, was the great absence, while Modric was the great winner. The readers of As bet by the replica of that script, with the Croatian dethroning again to CR7, this time in The Best, and breaking its hegemony with an award that has been carried in the two editions since the divorce with the Ball of Gold. The 42,311 responses to As’s question suggest that there will be two without three.
Very far from the 34,783 votes received by Modric appear Cristiano, second classified with 5,815 supports, and Salah, third with 1,713. In front of the Portuguese and the Egyptian, the voters have pondered more the merits of the Croatian Real Madrid : Golden Ball of the World Cup , where Croatia made history reaching the final and he scored three MVPs, the thirteenth Champions, the World Cup Clubs, the Supercopa of Spain and the Supercopa de Europa.
