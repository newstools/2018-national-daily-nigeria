President of Actors’ Guild of Nigeria (AGN) Ejezie Emeka Rollas for the first time on Friday, August 30 did what many thought was impossible as he presented a cheque of N700,000 (seven hundred thousand naira) to the family of late actor, Chukwudi Bambino Anachina. This is a sign for better things to come true to his promise of always having as priority the welfare of members of the Nollywood community.
It was gathered that the money was raised through the AGN member donations to the welfare of the children of late Bambino. Bambino’s wife who is still in mourning mood appreciated the gesture and thanked the body for their kindness and promised to make judicious use of the money. Rollas re-iterated his commitment to the guild as he called on actors to support the AGN foundation which was recently launched to cater for ailing actors.
He said: “This is the first time AGN is doing this. “This is a new administration and we are geared towards making sure that the welfare of our members is paramount.
“We are making arrangement to form a co-operative society among members so that during death, we can make members benefit from what they are earning as actors.
“We also launched the AGN foundation and I am calling on actors home and abroad to key into this foundation so that we can raise the N500m endowment fund. “With your help we will achieve this and many more.” Emeka Rollas was accompanied by the burial planning committee, some of his executives and Special Assistants, Dadi Monso, Ifeoma Okeke, Frank Dallas, Matthew Nwankwo, Chukky Egbu, Saint Maradonna, among others.
