Arserne Wenger may have been brutally sacked at Arsenal but he has not lost his love of the Beautiful Game.
The 68-year-old Frenchman played in a charity football match in his homeland and looked pretty sharp speeding down the wing.
The game took place in Nancy, and was to raise money for sick children.
It was also in memory of Aldo Platini, father of French legend Michel, who died in December.
Various photos were shared on social media that show Wenger on the ball in baggy white shorts and a red shirt.
There were also rumours that the former Gunners boss scored in the game, although this has yet to be confirmed.
National daily has reported how Wenger has dropped the biggest hint yet that he is ready for a return to a high-profile job â€“ after lining up Fenerbahce director of football Damien Comolli to go with him.
Wenger has been taking a break since leaving Arsenal at the end of last season, but has been assembling his backroom staff behind the scenes in preparation for his next management role.
