An Ex-Officio member of the Sports Writers Association of Nigeria (SWAN) Alloy Chukwuemeka has described the communique issued by the Lagos Chapter of the association as laughable and falls short of the true reflection of issues as they were presented,National Daily learnt.
Chukwuemeka described the action as an outcome of communication gap between the leadership of the chapter and the members.
Reacting to the said communiqué by the Lagos chapter wherein it  said it was not part of the meeting where the issue of SWAN registration was tabled, he said such statement was far from the truth and an attempt to misinform the public .
According to him, “All the 37 chapters of the association which included Lagos was present at that Full Council Meeting in Port Harcourt, and the entire Council applauded the National Executive Committee (NEC) for the commendable efforts.
He therefore called on members of the public to discountenance the communique, while urging NEC not to take such faulty document aimed at ridiculing the Association with levity; suggesting that disciplinary measures will not be out of place following such exhibition of high level ignorance of the Statutes.
Besides, he stated categorically that two of the signatories to the said communiqué, Dapo Sotiminu and Effiong Nyong are currently not registered members of the Association, hence their signatures further justifies the illegality and untenability of the purported document.
“I therefore wish to call on all well meaning individuals to discard the said communiqué and its content in entirety as it is not the true reflection of affairs.
“The present national leadership under the President, Honour Sirawoo is doing well and deserve commendation by all and sundry for the good job being done to give SWAN a facelift ” he stressed.
“As an Ex-Officio member, I have reached out to some elders and also the Zonal Vice President of the South West, Adegboye Ajayi; those disrespecting the Statutes of the Association know the prescribed solution to every situation, and this NEC is capable of enforcing the solution.
“I have not been able to establish contact with the President, but I spoke with his Deputy, Umar Sa’id; I urge our members in Lagos to be patient and remain law abiding; I can  assure you that NEC will act appropriately in line with the Statutes,” he summed up
