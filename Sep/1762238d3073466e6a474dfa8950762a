Real Madrid defender, Marcelo believes Cristiano Ronaldo is not the only star the club misses.
Ronaldo, who is the leading goalscorer at the Bernabeu switched to Juventus in the summer, ending his nine-year stay with Madrid.
Madrid started the season well, dropping points for the first time in the draw against Athletic Bilbao.
Asked if Madrid missed five-time Ballon d’Or winner Ronaldo, left-back Marcelo told reporters: “I think supporters also often remember Raul, Zidane… Not only Cristiano.”
“The draw is a bit disappointing,” Marcelo added. “We were hoping for a fairer outcome, which would have been to win the game.
“We gave it our all to do so and we improved in the second half but we have to move on from this game and think about the next. We had a lot of the ball and created chances but it just wouldn’t go in for us. We’ve got a fantastic team, we played well, but we couldn’t win the game.
“We didn’t want to drop any points here. We also lacked a bit of patience. After going behind, we tried to get on top quickly, but that’s the way things go in football. We came very close to getting the three points. We’re firing on all cylinders right now.”
