Romelu Lukaku is now up to 43 goals in 77 international matches. Figures to say to you. The striker furthered his statistics in Iceland with two hits.
“We win a lot, score a lot of goals and play offensive football. That’s nice, “let ‘Big Rom’ record afterwards. “It’s just a shame that after the World Cup we do not have a prize in our hands yet. Everyone sees us as one of the best teams in the world. Now it’s up to us to prove that we can also win prizes. ”
In an interview with ‘Business Insider’, Lukaku surprised with a stiff quote in mid-August. “Two more years and then the next generation may take my place”, it sounded then. Does Romelu stay with that position? “I said what I said,” he said tonight. “I want to enjoy the moments with my teammates at the national team and am satisfied with our performance.”
