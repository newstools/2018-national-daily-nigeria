Former Inter and Milan striker Ronaldo has officially become the majority shareholder of Spanish club Real Valladolid.
A Press conference was held on Monday to confirm Ronaldo had bought a 51 percent stake in Valladolid for a reported €30m.
“We want to grow the club as much as our enthusiasm permits,” explained Brazil’s all-time top goalscorer alongside predecessor Carlos Suarez.
“I can assure you that I have love inside of me for Valladolid and Real Valladolid.
“For me it’s a very important day. I’ve gone through many stages to prepare myself in and out of football.”
The 42-year-old had previously owned a part of American side Fort Lauderdale Strikers before their dissolution in 2016.
Valladolid, for their part, are back in La Liga this season after a four-year absence.
