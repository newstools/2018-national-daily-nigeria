Having thrashed Anastasia Sevastova in a mere 66 minutes to reach her ninth US Open final, Serena Williams sent out a warning to any rivals who hoped her comeback would be brief,National Daily gathered.
“This is just the beginning,” she told the on-court interviewer Tom Rinaldi. “I’m only a few months in and really looking forward to the rest of the year and next year.”
Nobody was quite sure what to expect when Williams made her return from the birth of Alexis Olympia, who arrived on Sept 1, 2017. Her play was patchy in her early tournaments, her movement sluggish. But on Thursday night, Williams rediscovered peak form in her most compelling display since she went away on maternity leave.
“It was tough for sure,” said Sevastova, who came out with a canny gameplan that involved slicing the ball back deep as often as possible and waiting for Williams to miss.
This approach had worked for Roberta Vinci in the semi-final here three years ago, and it made early inroads when Williams was broken in her opening service game and soon found herself trailing 2-0.
