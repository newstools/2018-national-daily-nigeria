A non-governmental organisation, Human and Environmental Development Agenda Resource Centre (HEDA), has dragged the Inspector General of Police, Ibrahim Idris, before A federal high court in Lagos, seeking the probe of an alleged NYSC certificate forgery by the Minister of Finance, Kemi Adeosun.
National Daily gathered that HEDA filed a motion exparte at the court, requesting an order compelling the IGP to investigate the allegations of certificate forgery against the minister.
Recall that an online news platform had broken the story, alleging that the minister had forged an exemption certificate of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC).
Meanwhile, the corps in response said the finance minister applied for an exemption but it would investigate the issue.
In a petition earlier forwarded to the IGP, HEDA had asked the police to investigate Adeosun and if found guilty, prosecute her.
In a statement on Sunday, Olanrewaju Suraju, HEDA chairman, said it chose to approach the court to ensure that the matter is not swept under the carpet “like most of such allegations involving politically exposed persons”.
It prayed the court for: “An order granting leave to the applicant to apply for an order of mandamus compelling the office of the IGP to investigate and publish its report on the allegations of forgery of NYSC certificate against Nigeria’s finance minister; Mrs. Kemi Adeosun.
“And for such further order or orders as the honourable court may deem fit to make in the circumstances.”
Adeosun has not reacted to the allegation since it was first reported.
