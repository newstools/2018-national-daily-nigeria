Cristiano Ronaldo spoke about Real Madrid after scoring his goal for Juventus, the Portuguese attacker played three barren matches for the Turin outfit before getting back on track in his fourth game to grab a brace against Sassuolo on Sunday.

Ronaldo was under intense pressure to open his scoring account with his new team after his Italian-record move of €112m from Real Madrid.

However, the No 7 finally got off the mark during the Bianconeri’s 2-1 win against Sassuolo, bagging a second-half brace.

“Obviously, I was a bit anxious with all the talk after my move from Real Madrid and not scoring, so there were a lot of expectations, but I thank my teammates for supporting me throughout.

“I knew I was working well and that it was only a matter of time. I am adapting well to Italian football.

“The Champions League is my favourite tournament. It’s a very difficult group, we know that we can do well and Juve must focus on being the best,” he told Sky Sport



Ronaldo and his crew will travel to Spain to play Valencia at the Mestalla Stadium in the Champions League on Wednesday.
