Legendary former Juventus player Alessandro Del Piero commented on the scary Cristiano Ronaldo during the UEFA gala, in which Luka Modric was awarded the best player of the year award. ‘Pinturicchio’ acknowledged in Sky Italia that he understands the Luso’s anger, but instead if he had come to the meeting: “There is controversy because there was some problem, something did not work. If Cristiano had said ‘I can not go to Monte Carlo’ nothing would have happened. I would also get angry in his place, but not going to the gala is something else. ”
However, the Italian defined the white midfielder as the winner of the award: “Modric did something extraordinary in Madrid and in the World Cup, so the prize was well deserved, but Cristiano also had a wonderful season. Golden Ball? Many times the winner wins the UEFA prize … ”
On the moment of Cristiano, who still has not scored goals in the Serie A after three days, Del Piero said: “In Italy we defend looking for the numerical superiority and it is complicated for a striker, Cristiano must know his new championship. Juve can be very happy: they have won all the games without their goals or those of Dybala “.
