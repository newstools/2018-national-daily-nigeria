Former West Ham manager Slaven Bilic has been named as the new coach of Saudi Arabian side Al-Ittihad.
The Croatian, who was sacked by West Ham in November last year, signed the deal with Al-Ittihad in New York on Thursday.
“Bilic will train Ittihad throughout the upcoming phase of the sports season,” a club statement read.
“The board wished Bilic all success in his new mission to help Ittihad regain its outstanding performances.”
Al-Ittihad currently play in the Saudi Professional League, and have opened their 2018-19 campaign with three losses and one draw in four games.
The club sacked former Argentina international Ramon Diaz – who managed Oxford United in 2004-05 – after their poor start.
