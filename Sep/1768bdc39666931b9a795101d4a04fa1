The President of the Senate, Dr. Bukola Saraki, has dared former Vice President Atiku Abubakar in the race for the presidential ticket of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. Saraki, on Monday, took mobilization and campaign to the home state of the Director General of Atiku’s Presidential Campaign Organization, Otunba Gbenga Daniel, to lobby leaders of Ogun PDP to support his PDP candidacy ambition for 2019 presidential election.
The Senate President passionately solicited the votes of the Ogun PDP delegated at the PDP national convention fixed to hold on October 5 into October 6, 2018, which is also being contested by Atiku.
Saraki acknowledging previous overtures by other presidential aspirants, including Atiku, appealed for support with the promise to serve the interest of Ogun people and Nigerians when elected president.
The Senate President remarked that his leadership record in politics demonstrates that Nigerians would feel a sense of belonging when voted president.
Saraki declared: “The Asian Tigers did not become world leaders by luck but through a process of purposeful leadership which have continued to stand for equity and justice.
“I represent such leadership and I plead with you not to vote by sentiment but to vote for ability and capacity.”
The PDP sole gubernatorial aspirant in the state, Hon. Ladi Adebutu, commended Saraki for his exemplary leadership role.
Ogun PDP State Chairman, Sikiru Ogundele, was gathered to have wished Saraki well in his presidential ambition.
The responses, however, showed that the Ogun PDP delegates may have made up their minds on the Atiku project in support of the former Governor of the State, Gbenga Daniel. Sarki was, however, aware of the political calculations in the state before making overtures.
