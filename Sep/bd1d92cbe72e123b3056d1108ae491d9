FC Barcelona is clear about their ‘timings’. And now, after closing the summer transfer and transfer market, it is now time to renew and extend the contract of one of the team’s permanent owners, Jordi Alba (29 years old). The side of L’Hospitalet de Llobregat ends contract in 2020 and according to the parameters of the club, it is time to start the contacts to reach an agreement no later than 2019.
The 2017-2018 season began with the will to renew the contracts of Leo Messi, Sergi Roberto and Gerard Piqué. Once the long-awaited signature of the Argentine was achieved until 2021, the cases of the lateral and central defender were dealt with. Both were also signed successfully, in his case until 2022. And after two seasons showing that his signing was a success, he attacked the improvement and extension of the contract of Samuel Umtiti, who signed just before the World Cup. A masterful move because later he was proclaimed champion.
After renewing four struts, signing four new players and taking many players out of the squad, it’s time to focus on Alba, who has won it.
In the club there is a firm will to renew given his great performance. Of course, within economic parameters consistent with the economy of the club, which has in the containment of the wage bill one of its workhorses.
The player wants to follow, obviously, but delegates to their representatives. One of them publicly expressed his impatience and his displeasure with the club because they had not yet called him to renew. Those public statements did not sit well with the club because of the pressure that was involved, while in the agency of Alba it was argued that they were due to not even receiving a call to place them at a future appointment. A call that should arrive shortly from the Camp Nou with a clear objective: that Jordi, the undisputed holder, will continue many more years of Barça.
