France and Belgium first-ever joint ranking leaders Belgium have climbed to the top of the FIFA/Coca-Cola World Ranking, alongside 2018 FIFA World Cup™ winners France, which means that the top spot is currently being shared for the first time in the table’s 25-year history. A pair of wins for the Red Devils (1st, up 1), including their first in the UEFA Nations League over Iceland (36th, down 4), has brought them level with Les Bleus (1st, unchanged) on 1,729 points. The only other change in the top ten sees Denmark (10th, down 1) slip below Spain (9th, unchanged). Outside of the top ten, two Nations League wins for Ukraine (29th, up 6) over Czech Republic (47th, down 3) and Slovakia (26th, unchanged) means that they are the month’s biggest movers, while Germany (12th, up 3) have started to edge back toward the upper reaches. The biggest leap in terms of points is in Africa, however, with Kenya (107th, up 5) clinching 22 points – 17.9 of which thanks to a 1-0 win over Ghana (51st, down 6) in CAF Africa Cup of Nations qualifying. As a result of that defeat to Kenya, the Black Stars join Slovenia (61st, down 6), as the biggest fallers of the month. Among the 154 matches played over the past month, the CONCACAF Nations League qualifiers have also resulted in some notable climbs, with Nicaragua (128th, up 4), St Lucia (166th, up 4), Belize (160th, up 3) and Aruba (185th, up 3) all moving up the table. Meanwhile, Lebanon (77th, up 2), Luxembourg (82nd, up 3) and Kosovo (138th, up 3) – the latter courtesy of their first competitive win – are all currently in their highest-ever ranking position. The next FIFA/Coca-Cola World Ranking will be published on 25 October 2018. Leaders France (unchanged) and Belgium (up 1) Moves into top 10 None Moves out of top 10 None Matches played in total 154 Most matches played Cuba (5 matches)
