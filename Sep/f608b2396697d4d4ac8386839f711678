The salary limits stipulated by LaLiga Santander for each of the league’s clubs have been released and it has been revealed that Barcelona can spend up to 632.97 million euros, while Real Madrid can spend up to 566.53m euros.
This isn’t a concern for either club as they have more than enough room to cover their wage costs, but it is interesting that Los Blancos have a lower ceiling – by 66.5m euros – than their rivals.
One of the main reasons why Barcelona are allowed to spend more on wages has to do with the fact that they’ve presented greater income than Real Madrid.
The new deal with Nike and their shirt sponsorship agreements have brought in significant money, as have the sales of players like Paulinho, Lucas Digne, Yerry Mina, Aleix Vidal, Gerard Deulofeu and Andre Gomes.
Clubs are allowed to present income from transfers which equates to the average from the previous three years and, as such, Barcelona can also include the 222m euros they received from Neymar’s exit in this equation, which ultimately leads to greater salary spending capacity.
