Former Ekiti State Football Association chairman, Dr. Isaac Ayodele, has told the newly elected board of the Nigeria Football Federation led by the president, Amaju Pinnick, to make bringing all the football family together a priority, as they begin the next four years of their reign.
Speaking with cross section of journalists, while appreciating, his colleagues, the FA chairmen for a job well done, Ayodele said it is imperative for them to bring about developmental projects especially from the grassroots while also trying their best not to let their supporters, who voted massively for them, down.
He congratulated Pinnick and others for the success at the poll but said they must start work in earnest so as to take football to the next level in the country.
“I want to congratulate Pinnick and the rest for their success, however, they have to know that works just begin,” he said.
“One of the most important things for them now is to bring all the football stakeholders together and find a lasting solution to the constant crisis affecting the game in recent times.
“If the crisis continues, like the court cases and the rest, it might be difficult for sponsors to work with the board, and also difficult to build proper relationship with the outside world.
“They have to make sure they do all within their power not to let their supporters down. They should improve on what they did in the last four years. It is of note that the congress decided to vote for them massively especially the president and the first Vice President, Seyi Akinwunmi, because of the trust they have in them to develop football in the country.”
The board member of the League Management Company also called on the NFF to put machinery in place to prepare the Super Falcons for the next African Women Cup of Nations as he wishes them all the best.
