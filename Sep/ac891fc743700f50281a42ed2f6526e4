Transport Minister Rotimi Amaechi has defended the siting and planned construction of Transportation University at Presodent Muhammdu Buhari’s hometown Daura, Katsina state.
The construction of the N18 billion project is scheduled to start in 2019.
Amaechi told newsmen Tuesday there is nothing special about siting the university in the president’s hometown since “Daura is also part of Nigeria”.
“The president did not even know I will choose Daura.  Daura is part of Nigeria. If we sighted it in Sokoto, it is still part of Nigeria. So why is the emphasis on Daura?” he asked.
“If I had chosen Port Harcourt, Enugu, that is the same way I would have chosen Daura. The people of Daura should not be deprived of these things because the president is from there.”
