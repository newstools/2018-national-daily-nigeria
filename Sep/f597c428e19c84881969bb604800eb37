Former Head of State, General Ibrahim Badamosi Babangida, IBB, on Tuesday, stated in Minna, Niger State, that he is still undecided over support for the reelection ambition of President Muhammadu Buhari in the 2019 general elections.
National Daily gathered that hosting former Governor Orji Uzor Kalu of Abia State, a member of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, involved in massive campaign and mobilisation of support for Buhari’s second term election, who was on a courtesy visit at his Minna Hilltop residence on Tuesday, IBB was said to have indicated that he could consider whether to support of not to support the second term ambition of President Buhari.
Kalu had declared that he was in Minna, Niger State, to campaign for Buhari, adding that the President has done well to deserve re-election in 2019.
“I am in Minna to campaign for President Muhammadu Buhari. At the meeting with Babangida, I pleaded with him to support Buhari’s re-election bid.
“He has told me that he will think about it. To me, that is a positive response,’’ Kalu was cited to have declared, after the two-hour meeting.
Kalu had maintained: “Buhari is doing well. He has achieved a lot for us. He is already taking Nigeria back to our glorious days.” The former Abia State Governor further identified the massive investments in the railways and improved road network as some of the major achievements of the Buhari administration.
National Daily recalls that after the famous statement of former President Olusegun Obasanjo – The Clarion Call – urging Buhari to forget contesting for a second term, Babangida also made similar statement, reiterating Obasanjo’s position. IBB also joined Obasanjo in advocacy for generational leadership transition in Nigeria, advising Buhari to step down for a new and younger generation in Nigeria.
