The  Kano Federal Special Anti-Robbery Squad have impeded a Mercedes Benz ML350 on Hadeja Road, Kano, which was earlier snatched by a gang of armed robbers  from Masaka in Nasarawa State.

Four suspects, who were in the Sports Utility Vehicle, were also arrested, the Kano police spokesman, SP Magaji Majiya, said in a statement in Kano on Tuesday.
The suspects, he said, included Kenneth Adam, Ali Jafaru, Abdulkadir Shaka and Aliyu Audu,  who are residents of Masaka, Nasarawa and Gunduwawa Quarters, Kano, respectively.

Majiya explained that a gang of robbers had attacked a resident of Masaka on September 22, 2018 and dispossessed him of valuables and a Mercedes Benz ML350 with Abuja registration number, ABC 554AY.

He further said, that the command had also intercepted a large quantity of dried leaves suspected to be Indian hemp at Tudun Wazirchi and Badawa Qtrs, Kano, adding that 189 parcels estimated at N6. 6 million were recovered.

He added that, on September 19, at about 1500hrs, one Musbahu Usman aka Dangaja of Kofar Na’isa Qtrs and Nura Hussain, aka Lado, of Jambulo Qtrs, Kano, both extortionists, conspired and trailed a bank customer who had just withdrawn N500,000.

The suspects, he added, attacked their victim on Audu Bako Way, while he was boarding a tricycle, and stole  the money, injuring him in the process.

“They were pursued and arrested, while the money was recovered instantly. Investigation revealed the duo as habitual criminals, who have been frequently arrested for crimes, such as extortion, pick pocketing, theft of motorcycles  and have been charged to various courts for prosecution,” the statement explained.
