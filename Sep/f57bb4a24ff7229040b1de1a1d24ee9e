Rafael Nadal would not have behaved like Serena Williams did in the US Open final, says women’s world No 22 Barbora Strycova.

Williams has split opinion around the world with her behaviour during the straight-sets defeat to Naomi Osaka.

And Strycova has slammed her fellow professional for her nonsense attitude towards the official, which she claims you would not see from men’s world No 1 Nadal.

The Czech star also gave her backing to Ramos while slating the WTA, who bizarrely came out in defence of Williams.

“This is nonsense,” said Strycova.

“For umpires being women or men doesn’t matter. In comparison, I never saw Nadal shouting like that with an umpire.

“Ramos is tough, one of the best umpires in the world.

“He did what he had to do in that match, because she overstepped the limit.”
