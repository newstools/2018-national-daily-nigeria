The names of Real Madrid and Manchester United have now been added to the long list of European top clubs who have officially reported themselves to the midfielder Ali Dursun or Ajax. The interest of the two European superpowers, whom De Jong sees as strengthening for their midfield, seems to prove it uneven to Erik ten Hag. He rebounded him against PSV as a defender.
Successor Modric
In De Jong, the Royal sees the successor of Luka Modric in the long term, wants FC Barcelona, which seemed to be on pole position for a long time, and is willing to transfer 80 million euros to Amsterdam. Whether that will be enough in the end will turn out in the coming months, because money seems to play no role anymore in the insane hunt for De Jong. And to think that Ajax took over 300,000 euros from Willem II less than three years ago.
Director of player policy Marc Overmars is pleased to see how the European superpowers fight each other out of the tent. For the normally normal boy from Arkel, who is seen by the directors, trainers and scouts as one of the greatest European talents and where no one wants to take a chance. PSG, Manchester City, Bayern Munich, Tottenham Hotspur and FC Barcelona were all concrete and after the Champions League-meeting of Ajax with AEK Real Madrid and Manchester United know for sure.
Overmars
“I can neither confirm nor deny this”, Dursun replies to the question whether Real Madrid and Manchester United have reported to him. “You have to ask Marc Overmars because I send all the clubs that report to me to him.”
As a result, clubs that want to outperform the competition immediately want to do business with Dursun about the personal demands of De Jong bot. The agent may not want to talk to clubs until they have an agreement with Ajax.
