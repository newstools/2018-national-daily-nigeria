Rivers State Sports Commissioner, Hon Boma Iyaye on Saturday dissolved the number five field management committee for gross negligence and ineptitude,National Daily learnt.
Hon Iyaye who was at the facility located along Bende/Niger street in the Old Port Harcourt Township on Saturday for an official function frowned at the poor hygienic conditions in the vicinity.
He noted that the individuals who had been saddled with the responsibility of ensuring that the facility is well-maintained and kept in peak conditions had failed in their duties.
“This edifice (the number five field) is a facility that was built by the Rivers State Government to erase the notion that Tennis is an elitist sport,” Hon Iyaye said.
“This facility was built to bring the sport (Tennis) closer to the people and the Rivers Government subsequently set up a management committee to take care of the place.
“The least we expected from them was to maintain the facility, not structurally but by keeping it clean. That was not done as exemplified by how the place looks currently.
“We will get more capable individuals who can do the job to subsequently man the facility,” Hon Iyaye concluded.
The number five field integrates two Tennis courts and a Volley ball court.
