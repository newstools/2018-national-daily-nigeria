Amidst the rumor that the premium motor spirit, otherwise known as petrol is going to be scarce, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has assured that there is enough fuel in the country and that there is no need for panic buying of petroleum products by motorists and the public.
Recall that the Nigeria Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers (NUPENG) had given the federal government an ultimatum over a purported intervention by an arm of the security agencies in what the union viewed as purely labour matters involving a company and its workers in Delta State.
In a statement made available to National Daily by the NNPC on Friday, its spokesman, Ndu Ughamadu, said the corporation’s Group Managing Director, Dr. Maikanti Baru and his Management team, were engaging the parties involved, saying the parties are close to resolving the issues.
Ughamadu in the statement advised motorists and other consumers of petroleum products not to engage in panic buying as the NNPC Management was close to reaching an amicable resolution of the challenge.
NNPC assured that the corporation had adequate storage of petroleum products across the country and advised that they should not entertain any fear of petroleum shortages
