The Nigerian police have dismissed the three policemen who raided the Abuja residence of elder statesman Edwin Clark on Tuesday.
The Force spokesman, Jimoh Moshood, in a statement explained that IGP Ibrahim Idris has approved the dismissal of Insprs. Godwin Musa, Sada Abubakar and Yabo Paul “for the unauthorised, illegal and unprofessional misconduct in the search of the residence of Chief Edwin Clark in Asokoro, Abuja”.
Moshood also said that ASP David Dominic who led the operation had been queried and was being investigated for discreditable conduct, negligence of duty and act unbecoming of a police officer.
The ASP too may be dismissed.
Counsel to Clarke, Kayode Ajulo, however insisted on thorough investigations of the raid.
He believes the policemen could not have acted without authorisation.
