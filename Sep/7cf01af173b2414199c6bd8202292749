Barcelona won against PSV Eindhoven on Tuesday, as Lionel Messi, scored his 103rd goal in the UEFA Champions League with a dominant hat-trick.
The Dutch team is the 30th different club that the Argentine has scored against, since his debut goal against Panathinaikos in 2005.
Since then, Messi hasn’t stopped against opponents from anywhere around Europe, with Arsenal being his major victim as he has scored nine times against the Gunners.
Celtic and Milan follow closely, having conceded eight goals each to the Barcelona captain.
In the 2014/15 season Messi reached 77 goals to beat Raul Gonzalez’s record (71) and from that point on he has been hunting Cristiano Ronaldo for the all-time top scorer accolade.
Against PSV, Messi managed to overtake the Juventus forward in terms of hat-tricks scored in the major European competition.
Although Ronaldo has found the opposition’s net 120 times in the UCL, Messiseems eager to reach the figures of his former domestic rival.
Mauricio Pochettino’s Tottenham Hotspur will be Barcelona’s next opponent in the competition, as the Blaugrana will have to travel to Wembley on the third day of October. If Messi scores against the English team, they will be club No.31 on the list.
