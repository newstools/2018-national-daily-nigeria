Former spokesman of ex-President Goodluck Jonathan has declared his intention to contest a House of Reps ticket under the All Progressives Congress (APC).
Ima Niboro wants to represent Ughelli north/Ughelli south/Udu federal constituency at the lower chamber.
Niboro said he is running because he holds “aloft a beacon of hope.”
In a Facebook post, he said his desire to represent the people is not for the glitters of office–but because he has the reach and contacts to serve the people meritoriously.
“I have maintained that if we are to send someone to represent Ughelli South, Ughelli North and Udu in Abuja, why not a person that can hit the ground running,” he said.
According to him, part of the reason representatives have always failed to attract development to our homeland is because many of them are mere local champions.
