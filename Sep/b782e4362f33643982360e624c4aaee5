The change in style at Real Madrid is undeniable as Julen Lopetegui’s team have now broken the club’s overall passing record.
Such is the scale of this achievement, Los Blancos made 798 successful passes aganst Leganes, a feat they have never achieved since Opta started collecting data.
Only once, in the Club World Cup final against Kashima – which went to extra time – had Real Madrid tried more passes than against Leganes.
An astonishing 882 attempts were made against the Japanese side, compared to 869 against the Pepineros, with a 91.82 percent success rate in their last match.
After two and a half LaLiga Santander rounds, Real Madrid lead the passing statistics with 1,505, just ahead of Barcelona who have 1,470.
Lopetegui’s men are also ahead in terms of completed passes as well, at 90.76 percent to 87.89 percent.
