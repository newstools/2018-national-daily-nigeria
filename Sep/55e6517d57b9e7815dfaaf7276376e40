Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, the national leader of the All Progressive Congress, APC, has called Jide Sanwo-Olu a better candidate at the Lagos governorship primaries.
The former governor of Lagos state said Sanwo-Olu is a young man endowed with superlative vision and commitment and who also possesses a wealth of experience and exposure.
In a statement published on his Twitter account, Tinubu said Sanwo-Olu is the preferred candidate because he understands the importance of the blueprint for development of Lagos state.
“While possessing a wealth of experience and exposure, he is a young man endowed with superlative vision and commitment. Most importantly, he understands the importance of the blueprint for development.
“He esteems it as a reliable and well-conceived vehicle for the future development of the state. He also knows the value of reaching out and working with others in order to maximize development and provide people the best leadership possible.”
He also gave a hint of his grouse with the embattled governor of Lagos State Akinwunmi Ambode.
Tinubu accused Ambode administration of being selfish and deviating from the masterplan for the development of Lagos State. He accused the governor of not carrying everybody along in the administration of the state.
Ambode who is seeking a second term in office is facing a serious challenge from another aspirant Babajide Sanwo-Olu, propped up by Tinubu who has passed a vote of no confidence in the governor.
Earlier in the day, Lagos Governor, Akinwunmi Ambode said Sanwo-Olu, who is being backed by many, is not fit to govern Lagos state.
He went further to say the governorship aspirant was allegedly arrested for spending fake American Dollars at a nightclub in the United States of America.
