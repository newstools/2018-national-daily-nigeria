The Confederation of African Volleyball (CAVB) says it is backing Nigeria to host more international competitions as the ongoing U21 Men’s Africa Championship is hitch free,National Daily learnt

The suggestion was made by CAVB Executive Director Howyda Mondy recently in Abuja.

I’m very satisfied with the championship so far. I want to congratulate Nigeria for what they did at the grassroots. They just won the U19 Youth Games and qualified for next year’s World Championship. For so many years, Nigeria was not in the international arena, but now they are back” Mondy said.

The former volleyball player said, “I’ll send an appreciation letter to the good standard of the organization and secondly, I hope we organize more competition in Nigeria because it’ll increase the awareness about volleyball, the technical level and give chances to the players. We all know if you compete in your home land with supporters and people around you, you’re motivated a lot and play very well”.


“Nigeria is one of the greatest countries in Africa; I’ve been to many states in Nigeria and have attended too many Championships. Maybe for the last ten years after the All Africa Games, Nigeria was out of the organization of volleyball event.
