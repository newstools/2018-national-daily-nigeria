Henry Chima Okebugwu made his debut for his new side KS Kastrioti as they took on KS Korabi in the first leg of the Albanian Cup at the Korabi Peshkopi Stadium in Peshkopi, Diber County,National Daily learnt.
It was a difficult encounter from the get go for Kastrioti but the Nigerian Midfield Kingpin Henry Okebugwu was already asking questions of the defence of the home side with his sleek passing and quick feet causing chaos for The Peshkopi outfit.
The former FC Ifeanyi Ubah dynamo was the brain behind the opening goal of the contest as his pinpoint pass was met by the Pacy Pablo Gallago who slotted into the bottom left corner to strike first blood for the visitors in the 10th minute of the encounter.
Although Kastrioti were pushed back by their opposition three minutes later Courtesy of a Griselda Lika strike, they still looked likely to score as Henry dominated proceedings in the middle of the park that ended with both sides sharing the spoils ahead of the return leg at the Kastrioti Stadium, Kruje in a Fortnight.
Speaking after the Game Henry who was substituted in the 80th minute told National Daily that “I thank God for the opportunity to lace my boots for KS Kastrioti as they have a great project, a great team with a great Coach (Elvis Plori) who has an ambition for success that suits me and his tactics plays to my strengths. We had a tough and physical Battle against Korabi and even though we didn’t win we got a goal away from home putting us in the driver’s seat for the second leg at home.”
KS Kastrioti will now turn their attention towards their upcoming league game against 7th placed FC Kamza in the SuperLiga and hope that Henry Okebugwu would be fit and ready after he strained his groin which led to him not finishing the game and probably reduced the chances of his side finding the winning goal.
