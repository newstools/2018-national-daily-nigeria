Former Manchester City defender Joleon Lescott has admitted that club star David Silva is the “best player” he has ever played with. Since moving to England to play for the blue half of Manchester back in 2010 from La Liga outfit Valencia, Silva has gone on to establish himself as not only one of the greatest players ever to wear the famous City jersey but also one of the best midfielders the Premier League has ever seen. Speaking on BT Sport prior to Manchester City’s opening Champions League tie against Olympique Lyon, former club centre-back Lescott discussed the sheer talent that the former Spanish international possesses. Lescott said: “I’m glad everyone appreciates what he’s doing now. He’s getting a lot more recognition. “I don’t think he is doing anything different compared to what he did when he first joined the club. “People are starting to realise now that Manchester City are dominating possession, dominating games. He’s the figurehead. “He’s without a doubt the best player I’ve played with. I’ve never seen a person with so much control over the ball.” Silva has enjoyed a tremendous footballing career since his move back in 2010, winning a whole of silverware for both club and country. The epitome of the ‘City revolution’, Silva has won three Premier League titles, one FA Cup and three League Cups, as well as a whole host of individual honours. For his country, Silva was a big part of Spain’s world dominance between the years 2008-2012, where the European side won two European Championships and a World Cup in between in 2010.
