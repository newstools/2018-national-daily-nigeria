General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), Pastor Enoch Adeboye, says Nigerians should leave him out of the feud between Governor Akinwumi Ambode of Lagos state and his political godfather, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu.
In a statement issued on Pastor Adeboye’s social media accounts, the RCCG denied that Adeboye put a phone call across to APC godfather Bola Tinubu on behalf of Governor Akinwunmi Ambode of Lagos.
Ambode has fallen out with Tinubu and the APC godfather has settled for 53-year-old Babajide Sanwoolu to end Ambode’s bid for a second term in office.
Transcripts of an alleged phone conversation between Pastor Adeboye and Tinubu were made available to various media outlets in the past week.
But the preacher says he never rang Tinubu to discuss Ambode’s travails.
In the statement, Adeboye said he would not involve himself in politics,  “Our attention has been drawn to news making the rounds from dailies especially the New Telegraph that Pastor E.A Adeboye, the General Overseer of the RCCG had a recent phone conversation with the Leader of the All Progressive Congress (APC).
“We would like to inform the general public that this is false and Pastor E.A Adeboye has not and would not be involved in inter/intra party politics in Nigeria and anywhere RCCG is present across the world. Pastor E.A Adeboye advises all well-meaning Nigerians just like him to get their PVCs and exercise their civic duty.
Pastor Adeboye is notable friends with the Tinubus. He’s also on first name basis with a handful of politicians in the power corridors.
Vice President Yemi Osinbajo is a serving Pastor of the RCCG.
In August, Adeboye’s RCCG ordained Senator Oluremi Tinubu an Assistant Pastor. The ordination took place during the ministry’s 66th annual convention.
