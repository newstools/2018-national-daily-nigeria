The eldest son of Usman Sa’ad Abubakar, the Sultan of Sokoto, popularly called Amir, has been involved in an accident.
National Daily gathered that Amir, was seen earlier on Sunday leaving a guesthouse with a female companion, and was driving at a very high speed of over 200km/hr around 12 noon within Sokoto Airport Road, in an area called Bado, when the accident happened.
With him in the car were Khalifa Maccido, son of Aliyu Macciddo, and a girl he allegedly imported from Kaduna to have fun with.
Witnesses at the scene of the crash said Amir had been drunk while driving, and that a bottle of Benelyn Codeine syrup was found in the car.
While he was being taken to the hospital, officials of the Sultanate Council were seen removing the Sultanate council plate number from the car so as not to expose the Sultanate Council.
