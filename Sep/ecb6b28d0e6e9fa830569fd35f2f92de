Leaders of the All Progressives Congress (APC) have met with the candidate of the Action Democratic Party (ADP) in last Saturday’s governorship election, Alhaji Moshood Adeoti, ahead of tomorrow’s rerun election in Osun State.
The APC delegation was led by the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Mr Boss Mustapha.
The meeting with Adeoti, whose party came fourth in the election that was declared inconclusive by the Independent National Electoral Commission, came up after an earlier meeting with Senator Iyiola Omisore, whose Social Democratic Party came third in the election.
