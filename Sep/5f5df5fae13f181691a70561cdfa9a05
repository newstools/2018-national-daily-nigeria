The lingering discontentment in All Progressives Congress (APC) in Lagos State is spreading over several decisions of the godfather of Lagos politics, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu. The insistence of Tinubu to impose Honourable James Abiodun Faleke, representing Ikeja constituency in the National Assembly, on APC supporters in Lagos State in the 2019 elections has been responded to with strong opposition and resistance. The Lagos APC supporters are protesting that Faleke should go back to Kogi State for further elections after he had contested as Deputy Governorship candidate to late Abubakar Audu in the inconclusive Kogi State governorship election, which Yahaya Bello became the principal beneficiary in the controversies that trailed the death of Abubakar Audu.
A reliable party source in the state disclosed that people in Lagos State are not happy over Faleke’s imposition by Tinubu for re-election to the National Assembly in Lagos in the 2019 general elections. “People have been taken for fools in Lagos. Faleke made money in Lagos but use the money to develop his constituency in Kogi State. Yet, he still wants third term ticket of APC in Lagos for re-election into the National Assembly,” the APC stakeholder declared.
He stated that Tinubu is sending a very wrong message to APC stakeholders in Lagos, arguing that imposing Faleke for 2019 is a way of telling Lagosians that none of them is qualified for leadership role or for election into the National Assembly from that constituency.
Faleke was Chairman of Ojodu Local Council Development Authority (LCDA) before his election into the House of Representatives .
