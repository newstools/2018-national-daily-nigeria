Governor of Lagos state, Akinwunmi Ambode has restated his readiness to participate in the governorship election of the All Progressives Congress in the state scheduled for this Saturday.
In a statement issued by Kehinde Bamigbetan, Commissioner for Information, Ambode expressed gratitude to Bola Tinubu, a national leader of the party and other party leaders, saying their support, understanding and prayers have assisted him in no small measure in being used as an instrument through which the state has redefined the concept of greatness.
“As our great party approaches Saturday, September 29th, 2018, earmarked for the direct primary election to choose the candidate to fly our party’s gubernatorial flag at the next general election, I am happy to restate my commitment to participate in that process having procured and submitted my nomination form and having formally declared my intention to seek a second term to continue on the path of unprecedented growth and development that our State has witnessed since 2015” the statement read.
The statement added that the governor in seeking re-election is approaching the founding fathers and teeming members of the party with a “grateful heart, open arms and a pledge to open and deeper attention to the concerns of this one, big family”.
It added that a return of the party’s ticket to Ambode will guarantee the stability of the state’s growing economy; ensure the continuation of the growth and development it has witnessed over time and ensure that the opposition does not take root in the state.
He congratulated Babajide Sanwo-Olu and Obafemi Hamzat, his co-contestants for their courage and commitment to the party and urges party faithful to come out en masse and vote peacefully in all the 20 local governments and 245 wards where the election will take place.
