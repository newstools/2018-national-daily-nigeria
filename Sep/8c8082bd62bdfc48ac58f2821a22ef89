The all conquering Buruj Sports Academy are billed to present the trophies they won during this yearâ€™s edition of English Super Cup in Manchester, the United Kingdom to the performing and sports-loving Governor of the State, Mr. Akinwunmi Ambode,National Daily gathered.
The players and officials who jetted in on Thursday evening aboard Turkish airline from Istanbul, where they had a stop-over, dazzled all-comers during the competition organised by Team Tours Direct to defend the title they won last year, adding some gloss by also bagging the youth trophy of the tournament to make it a double.
According to the founder the delay in presenting the trophy to the Governor up till now is not unconnected with the current political impasse in the state which is now settling down.
The management of the academy have promised to continue to represent the state and country creditably by producing more young football talents who will take the world of football by storm in a not too distant future and win more laurels to boost the sporting profile of Lagos State.
