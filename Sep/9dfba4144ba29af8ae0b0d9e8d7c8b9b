The many bad roads across Lagos State major high ways have been identified as one of the reasons why hoodlums still attack and rob motorists and pedestrians along the roads within the state metropolis.

National Daily investigations revealed that the present administration of Governor Akinwunmi Ambode had good intention for the state by awarding many road dualisation project for the well being of the state but virtually all the projects are yet to be completed, making traffic movement in the state to be very slow.

The traffic now gives hoodlums the opportunity to attack motorists robbing them of their valuables and cash. The hoodlums at most time come in group and always target exotic cars mainly at night where there is no security presence before they strike.

 Following series of complaints from residents of the state who had been victims, the Police authorities decided to strategies on how to get the culprits.

The State Commissioner of Police(CP) Imohimi Edgal in its strategic move to get the criminals directed the Rapid Response Squad(RRS) to move in foot operatives along the major roads. The operation paid off recently as five traffic robbers were arrested within the metropolis.

In an encounter with National Daily, one of the suspected traffic robbers said “We are capitalising on the major roads that are yet to be completed across the state. We operate easily on bad roads, it is very easy difficult to attack motorists on smooth roads but now you can see most of the road projects are yet to be completed and the roads are bad.

“So it is very easy for us to attack our victims along bad road”  Said the suspect.”
