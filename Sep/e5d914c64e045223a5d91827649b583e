The lingering inconclusive horse trading for elections tickets has thrown the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, into deepening uncertainties in the party’s preparations for the 2019 general elections. Accordingly, the National Working Committee, NWC, of the ruling APC on Wednesday announced new dates for the conduct of primary elections to nominate candidates for the 2019 general elections.
APC National Organizing Secretary, Emma Ibediro, in statement in Abuja after the Committee’s meeting on Wednesday, indicated that the new dates for the primary elections are as follows:
