John Terry’s proposed move to Russia to join Spartak Moscow has been called off by the former Chelsea captain ,despite club offering deal worth £3m-a-year,National Daily learnt.
￼
The former England defender had flown by private jet to Rome on Friday for a medical with the club ahead of finalising personal terms on a tax-free deal, believed to be in the region of £3million a year.
Terry stated that  ‘After considerable thought, I have decided to decline a contract offer from Spartak Moscow. I would like to take the opportunity to thank Spartak and wish them and their supporters well .
National Daily learnt that the 37-year-old has had numerous offers since leaving Aston Villa as a free-agent in the summer following their play-off final defeat to Fulham.
Terry has kept himself fit by training throughout the summer and admitted to Sportsmail that he was ‘still hungry to play if everything around it is right’.
I am in the best condition I have been in for the last eight to 10 years of my career,’ said Terry.
Spartak arranged the medical at Rome’s Villa Stuart clinic on Saturday lunchtime to speed up the move, with agent Marco Trabucchi sent over to oversee the final negotiations.
That medical saw Terry post an apology as he had to withdraw from a ‘Match for Cancer’ at Celtic Park on the same day, writing: ‘I’m sorry I can’t be there today to support James Milner and Stiliyan Petrov today at Celtic Park.’
Spartak are due to face Steven Gerrard’s Rangers in the Europa League and are also chasing the domestic title, just two points off the leaders Zenit St Petersburg, who are captained by his former Chelsea team-mate Branislav Ivanovic.
