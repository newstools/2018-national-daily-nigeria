Tiger Woods’s Ryder Cup record went from bad to worse when he lost two more matches on Saturday.
Europe will go into Sunday’s singles matches needing only four and a half points from a possible twelve to regain the Ryder Cup after dominating a sun-kissed Saturday at Le Golf National.
Leading 5-3 overnight, Europe came out charging on another crisp, clear-blue French morning to take three points from four in the morning’s fourballs and establish an 8-4 lead, just 24 hours after being 3-0 down.
The second most prolific major champion of all time now has nine wins, 19 losses and one halved match in Ryder Cup fourball and foursomes.
He has lost seven consecutive times in the team format, a dreadful record that defies easy explanation, not that people will shy away from trying.
Woods said he had not played as poorly as his three losses suggested.
“Just pretty pissed off, the fact that I lost three matches, and didn’t feel like I played poorly,” he said.
“That’s the frustrating thing about match play. We can play well and nothing can happen.”
