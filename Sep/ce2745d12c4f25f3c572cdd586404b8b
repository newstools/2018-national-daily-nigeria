The hometown of enbattled Lagos Gov. Akinwumi Ambode have embarked on divine moves to save their son from the fury of APC national leader Bola Tinubu.
The governor made a string of missteps which created bad blood between him and his godfather, and also dim the hope of his second term in 2019.
Efforts by the presidency, some APC governors, and Oba of Lagos could not appease the wrath of the former governor who has already anointed a rival, Jide Sanwoolu.
But the religious majority in Epe are not sitting past.
The Olu-Epe of Epe town, Oba Sefiu Olatunji Adewale, was said to have attended a special Islamic vigil organised by the Muslim Community at the Epe Central Mosque, on Friday night and lasted till the early hours on Sunday.
The prayer session is an annual programme meant to pray for the general well-being of all Epe indigenes, though.
Residents said theÂ  crisis was the special focus of the vigil, and that every religion is united now in favour of Ambode.
But how far this will help the embattled Lagos governor is what many are waiting to see.
