Inter are still working on a renewal for Mauro Icardi, but reports suggest there’s a disagreement over salary.
The Nerazzurri are looking to tie their captain down to a new deal, as while his current contract expires in 2021, there is a €110m release clause for foreign clubs.
That clause is only valid for two weeks in July, but given the explosion in transfer fees in recent windows it’s no longer the deterrent it was intended to be when the contract was signed.
According to today’s Corriere della Sera, negotiations are ongoing with Icardi’s wife and agent, Wanda.
The plan is to extend until 2023, raising the release clause to at least €130m.
However, Icardi’s agent is asking for a salary of €8m per season, while the current offer on the table is €6.5m.
