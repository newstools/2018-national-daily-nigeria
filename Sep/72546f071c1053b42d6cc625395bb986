David Beckham’s 2020 vision for Inter Miami FC involves some of the biggest names in football including Zinedine Zidane, Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo.
And they don’t come much bigger than Argentina’s Messi who, by then will be 32, and with his Barcelona contract just having another 18 months to run.
With 70 per cent of the local population Hispanic, Beckham knows that a South American flavor is important to attract the crowds.
Those who suggest that the world’s greatest player wouldn’t be persuaded by the delights of Miami’s South Beach underestimate Beckham’s pulling power.
One of the first to congratulate Beckham on securing his dream of owning a football club? None other than Messi.
“Who knows maybe we can see him here in a few years time,” added the former Manchester United and England captain.
“We want to create the biggest club in the USA and so that means attracting some of the biggest players.”
One of the most important appointments for Beckham will be that of head coach and already there have been preliminary talks with his former Real Madrid team-mate Zidane.
The French star would ideally like to stay in Europe and is in Manchester United’s sights if they ever decide to part company with Jose Mourinho.
But the longer the Frenchman remains out of work the better chance Beckham will have of pulling off a managerial coup.
