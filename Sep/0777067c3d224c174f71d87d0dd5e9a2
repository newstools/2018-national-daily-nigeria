The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, on Sunday, commended the patriotic and courageous return of the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Right Honourable Yakubu Dogara, from the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC.
PDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, in a statement in Abuja, acknowledged that Dogara’s return was a courageous response to the party’s call on compatriots to rally with it and rescue the country.
Ologbondiyan maintained that Dogara’s decision to defect from the APC was a patriotic and nationalistic move which demonstrates that “he is a statesman, who is committed to the progress of the nation, particularly at this trying time.”
The PDP Publicity Secretary remarked Dogara’s defection was reflective of the wishes and aspiration of his larger constituency and in tandem with the determination of Nigerians across board to rally on the platform of the re-positioned PDP to vote out the APC administration.
He noted that Dogara had continued to conduct the affairs of the House of Representatives with the highest level of commitment, resulting in a very productive legislature under his leadership, “despite the unmitigated efforts” by the APC to distract him.
Ologbondiyan had declared: “Furthermore, the return of Dogara and other leaders, who had earlier left our fold is a clear testament that the issues that led to their exit in the first place have all been addressed under the re-positioned and rebranded PDP.
“The patriotic action of Dogara and other leaders, who left the APC, has further strengthened the surging hope by Nigerians as they collectively rally on the platform of the PDP to rescue our nation from the misrule and return her to the path of national cohesion, peace and economic prosperity for which our party is known.”
The PDP spokesman was of the view that Dogara’s return is a pointer to the victory of the PDP both in Bauchi State and at the Federal level, adding that his huge electoral value will contribute immensely to the return of PDP to power at all levels.
