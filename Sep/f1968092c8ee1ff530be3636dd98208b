Threaten actions against Nigerian Government




The United States of America, US, the United Kingdom, UK and European Union, EU, on Thursday, September 27, 2018, faulted the Thursday supplementary governorship election in Osun State, citing electoral irregularities and victimization of the Opposition Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, members and polling agents. The US, UK and EU Observer team during the collation of the Thursday supplementary governorship election results in Oshogbo, Osun State, protested the intimidation of voters, harassment of Election Observers and Journalists by the authorities responsible for the conduct of the election. The team of foreign Observers in a brief statement at the Collation Centre narrated their observations of that voters were intimidated in the voting process, adding that election observers and journalists were harassed and embarrassed during the supplementary election. They, therefore, condemned the actions of the authorities that conducted the supplementary election which ended in favour of the All Progressives Congress, APC, candidate. The Observer Team declared that the US, UK and EU will look into the electoral process for appropriate actions.
The report and protest of the foreign observers exposed the falsehood of the federal government that some fake election observers were arrested and that they were believed to be agents of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. The US, UK and EU protest further made the supplementary election in which the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, upturned the Saturday, September 22, 2018 governorship election result earlier won by the PDP candidate to declare the APC candidate winner of the Osun 2018 governorship election unpopular.
