A PDP agent has been arrested by security operatives for allegedly attempting to buy votes in the Sept. 21  Osun State governorship election.
The agent attempted to distribute money to voters at the Obada area of Ede in the Ede Local Government Area where the PDP candidate, Ademola Adeleke comes from.
Adeleke is contesting the seat against the APC candidate, Isiaka Oyetola, SDP’s Iyiola Omisore , Fatai Akinbade of the African Democratic Congress, and Adeoti Moshood of Action Democratic Party.
Vote-buying was a major blot on the conduct of the Ekiti election in June when the APC won the contest against PDP.
Local and international observers complained all the parties in the election were involved in the malpractice.
