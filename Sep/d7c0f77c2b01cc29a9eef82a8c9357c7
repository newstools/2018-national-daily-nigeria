Frank Lampard has ruled out the possibility of signing his former Chelsea and England team-mate John Terry for Derby County.
The Rams boss spent 13 years with the former ex-England captain at Stamford Bridge, and reports claimed that a reunion could be on the cards this season, with Terry looking for a new club after leaving Aston Villa at the end of the 2017-18 campaign.
Chelsea legend Terry was heavily linked with a move to Spartak Moscow, even undergoing a medical with the club.
However, he has turned down a move to the Russian outfit, despite a reported £3 million-per-year salary package being on offer.
“After considerable thought, I have decided to decline a contract offer from Spartak Moscow,” Terry explained in a statement.
“I would like to take the opportunity to thank Spartak and wish them and their supporters well for the rest of the season.
“They are an ambitious club and I have been very impressed with their professionalism.
“But after assessing this move with my family, we’ve decided this is not the right move for ourselves at this time. Good luck Spartak.”
Lampard has now scotched talk of them joining forces once again and says that Derby’s squad is complete, having brought in a number of players throughout the summer transfer window.
“The bookies don’t always get it right, do they?,” Lampard said.
“John is a fantastic leader, a fantastic player and he’s got a lot to offer.
“But we have options in defence, so there’s no more movement from us.
“John will be great wherever he goes, wherever he chooses or whoever chooses him.”
Lampard has made an impressive start to life in charge of the Rams, winning four of his six Championship matches in charge ahead of Saturday’s meeting with Rotherham United.
