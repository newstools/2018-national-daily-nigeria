…say resignation diversionary
Nigerians have flooded social media with different reactions after Kemi Adeosun resigned her position as Minister of Finance following allegation of a forged NYSC exemption certificate.
According to a reliable source, the minister in her resignation letter told the President that her position no longer tenable in the cabinet. She also thinks she’ll be a liability to President Buhari’s re-election plans if she stays on, hence the resignation.
Well, whatever her motive was, Nigerians are certainly having their say about her decision on social media.
While some applaud her for finally doing the needful, others berate her timing, and more also skeptical about her real intentions.
One of the tweet demanded for her arrest, asking how Nigeria could have been so indebted and so poor in a matter of three years. The tweet also asked Nigerians not to relent as the sudden resignation of the minister could be a mere diversionary tactics by the presidency.
Another tweeter commended the media for a thorough investigative work, he however knocked some politicians who defended Adeosun knowingly fully well that the allegation against her was true.
Recall that despite the public pressure on Buhari to fire the minister or, at least, acknowledge the situation, he has not said anything about the controversy which first surfaced two months ago.
Earlier in August, the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, said the president’s image has not been dented in any way by the controversy.
He said the president cannot act until the allegations have been proven to be genuine by the appropriate authorities.
In July, NYSC promised to investigate the origin of the purported exemption certificate but no update has been provided after several weeks.
