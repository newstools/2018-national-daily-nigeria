The governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, in 2015, Mr. Jimi Agbaje, has joined the race for the PDP governorship ticket for the 2019 election in Lagos State.
Agbaje who lost to incumbent Governor Akinwumi Ambode of the All Progressives Congress, APC, in 2015, has collected nomination and expression of interest forms at the National Secretariat of the PDP in Abuja.
Agbaje would be slugging it out with Femi Otedola and others for the PDP ticket in Lagos.
Since the 2015 elections, Agbaje joined the race for the PDP National Chairman but stepped down at the stage of negotiations to prune down the number of contestants.
The former PDP governorship candidate has intensified preparations for the primary election of the party across the country.
