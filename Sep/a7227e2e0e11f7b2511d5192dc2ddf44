The Harmony Boys have been drawn in Group C of the round of 16 where they will face Kano Pillars, Rivers United and Abia Warriors.

Since the creation of the Ilorin based club, they have never won the League Cup, and the last time they even got to the last 16 stage was in 2012 under Coach Tunde Sanni.

Sir Thompson Oladimeji has now vowed to do everything possible that will help his players to make history this year in the Aiteo Cup.

“I have always been supporting my players and I am still ready to make them happy for them to bring the 2018 Aiteo Cup to Kwara State.

“I believe in my players and the technical crew, and I am very sure that they will deliver and make all Kwarans happy,” the business mogul explained.

Last season, current Kwara United coach Abubakar Balah steered Niger Tornadoes to the final of the Aiteo Cup, but lost to Akwa United.

This term, he is in charge of the same championship and he has also promised to make Kwara fans happy by winning the Aiteo Cup.

Meanwhile, the round of 16 for the 2018 Aiteo Cup will start on September 24-28 in which two teams will qualify for the last 8 from Group C and other Groups.
