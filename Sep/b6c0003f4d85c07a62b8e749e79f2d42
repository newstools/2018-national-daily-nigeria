All is not well yet with Lagos Gov. Akinwumi Ambode despite the intervention of Oyo Gov. Isiaka Ajimobi, andd Oba of Lagos Rilwan Akiolu in the on-going crisis between the governor and his godfather Bola Tinubu.
The logjam still effectively keeps the governor’s fate for a second term hanging in the air.
New aspirants allegedly backed by Tinubu emerged Tuesday, and one of them, Jide Sanwoolu is said to be having the blessing of the APC national leader and 57 council chairmen in the state.
It was gathered President Muhammadu Buhari summoned Tinubu to Abuja Wednesday over the matter.
The meeting was reportedly masterminded by Nigeria’s First Lady Aisha Buhari, who, according to reports by the Punch, was said to have been called by members of the Committee of Wives of Lagos State Officials.
The body is led by Lagos First Lady Bolanle Ambode.
However, the Aso Rock meeting did not yield much either as Tinubu did not back down from the decision of the 57 local government chairmen and others loyalists of the national leader–that Sanwoolu should become the next governor of Lagos State.
Why Tinubu is bent on easing Ambode out is fairly complicated. Sources said the governor has siidelined party elders, offended many by scrapping the PSP waste management scheme, sacking highway managers, awarding contracts to cronies, and ignoring advice from party leaders.
“However, the presidency has put pressure on Asiwaju and although the man has yet to back down, there is hope because he has gone back to Lagos to consult with his followers in the mandate group. We hope that all will be well,” the Punch reported.
Ambode has been responding in the media by denying the frosty relationship between him and Tinubu.
But the situation is so bad that he had only APC chairman Adams Oshiomhole word before he bought his nomination form for a second term recently.
