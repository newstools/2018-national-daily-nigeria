Speaker Yakubu Dogara has finally dumped the ruling APC for his former party PDP–to realise his 2019 ambition.
He picked the PDP nomination and expression of interest forms to return to the House in 2019 Wednesday night, according to sources in the PDP National Working Committee.
Dogara had told his constituents days ago about his decision to hop out before 2019, though he didn’t state the party he would move into.
The Speaker and his Senate counterpart Bukola Saraki had a rough time in the APC the joined in 2014 as members of the rebel faction nPDP.
Dogara may also face crises similar to Saraki’s —quitting the House leadership he got through the APC—when the House reconvenes in October.
