As anxiety rises over the chance of Lagos Gov. Akinwumi Ambode’s getting a second term in 2019 owing to the crisis between him and his Bola Tinubu, external forces are moving in to pacify the angry godfather.
All the 57 local government chairmen in Lagos have taken side with Tinubu, and two other contestants, one, Jide Sanwolu, backed by the APC national leader have emerged.
Although the APC national chairman and Tinubu’s ally Adams Oshiomhole told Ambode he had his back, the governor appeared to be in for a rude shock as intrigues mounted.
However, President Muhammadu Buhari, Oyo State Governor Abiola Ajimobi; and Oba of Lagos, Rilwan Akiolu are said to have moved in to make peace, and save the rookie governor.
“There are serious moves to end the crisis. Many people, including the President have waded in. And it is not yet too late for the issue to be resolved,” a source told the Punch.
“President Buhari, Governor Abiola Ajimobi of Oyo State and Oba Rilwan Akiolu are making efforts to ensure that the matter is resolved and Ambode’s second term bid is not terminated,” the source added.
The cause of the rift between Tinubu and the governor is not yet clear, but sources said the APC national leader has been sidelined in the affairs of the administration.
Ambode, on Tuesday, however denied there was a rift between him and his godfather.
