Super Eagles stand-in captain, John Ogu who left Nigeria Friday evening, made it back in time for Hapoel BeerShevaâ€™s tricky away match to SC Ashdod, National Daily learnt.

The commanding midfielder who has become an indispensable player for the Israeli Champions and leads the goalscoring deprtament so far with 4 goals from 8 matches in all competitions, was immediately drafted into the starting line up upon arrival

Ogu who had an amazing outing as the Super Eagles captain during the last National assignment against Liberia, got a yellow card for his troubles and was not flying out the blocks as usual, which might be attributed to the effects of jet lag

Ashdod took the lead early in the first half when Josip Ivancic broke the dead luck and scored what turned out to be the only goal of the encounter in the 13th minute

Hapoel BeerSheeva now find themselves in 10th position after three matches from which they have amassed an embarrassing 2 points and -1 goal difference, as their horrific defensive problems and poor start to the season linger.
