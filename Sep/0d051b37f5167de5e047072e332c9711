The former NFF boss has conceded defeat following Mr Amaju Pinnick victory at the NFF Elective Congress on Thursday in Katsina, National Daily learnt.

Aminu Maigari says he bears no grudge against anyone following his loss to Pinnick in the race to become president of the Nigeria Football Federation on Thursday.

The immediate past NFF boss lost his bid to return to the Glass House, garnering only eight votes to emerge as runner-up behind winner Pinnick, who secured 34 votes.

Prior to the NFF Elective Congress in Katsina, Maigari was almost disqualified over allegations of certificate forgery but was handed a provisional clearance to take part in the polls.

After the elections, the Bauchi-born football administrator hailed the CAF first vice president over his achievement in the last four-year, while urging more focus on football development.

“The vote has come and gone, and football is the winner,” Maigari told media in Katsina after warmly embracing the winner Pinnick.

“The focus is football development. I bear no grudge and I must say that I am indeed delighted by the strides that Amaju Pinnick has taken since taking over from me four years ago.
