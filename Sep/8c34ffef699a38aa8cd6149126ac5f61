Director of Youth Development in Remo Stars Football Club (RSFC) Daniel Ogunmodede has indicated his optimism that his wards will bring down Bendel Insurance FC when they face each other in one of Round 64 fixtures  of the Aiteo Federation Cup.
The Young Sky Blue Stars will take on the Nigeria National League (NNL) side at the Akure Township Stadium recently.
The Director acknowledged the style of play and doggedness of the team but optimistic that the Remo Stars Youth side will defeat them.
He told National Daily that “We know and understand that Insurance is a strong side judging by their position on their log table and the way they have presented themselves this year but we are ready to bring them down. We are working day and night to see how to counter their game plan.”
“We played well during Ogun State FA Cup and I believe if we can repeat such form in the Aiteo FA Cup, we will definitely spring up surprises, go far and at the end of the day, win the cup because football is a practical game, the way you lay your bed is the way you lie on it.”
“Football is the same language generally but the stage is always different, for my lads to have played and knocked Gateway FC out of the FA Cup then I don’t think any game should be big for them. Ninety Eight percent (98%) of the team will be playing against a big club for the first time, even first time playing in such stage or going to the FA Cup and playing against a club with such history in Nigeria Football won’t be easy.”
“I must be sincere with you that that boys aren’t going there to look at faces but going there for exhibition, a repetition of what they have showcase in training which is the purpose of their gathering here, basically for development and the boys will cherish this opportunity all through their life time.” Ogunmodede concluded.
