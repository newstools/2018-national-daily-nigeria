According to Spanish press, Ronaldo has threatened broadcaster Mediaset with legal action over a damning TV report about his girlfriend Georgina Rodriguez.
Cristiano Ronaldo has been outraged and threatened broadcaster Mediaset with legal action over a Spanish TV report about his partner Georgina Rodriguez, according to Spanish website Informalia.
Sálvame, a celebrity gossip programme on Mediaset channel Telecinco, aired a segment a few days ago in which it claimed that Georgina abandoned her family after she began dating the football star, severing her relationship with her father in Argentina and grandmother in Lorca, Spain. According to the report, both her father and grandmother are seriously ill.
Sálvame journalist Sergi Ferré claimed in the report that the social media I
grandmother felt abandoned despite having been like a mother to her, and that the 82-year-old is “very sick” and has been living in prefabricated housing in Lorca since the Spanish town was hit by an earthquake in 2011. Meanwhile, according to Salvame, her father is “gravely ill” in hospital in Argentina after having suffered a stroke.
Sálvmamé’s daming report of Georgina has reportedly sparked Ronaldo’s outrage. And according to Informalia, the ex-Real Madrid player instructed his lawyers to send a letter to Mediaset threatening legal action in a bid to prevent the broadcaster from airing any more reports on the matter.
Informalia also claims Mediaset has taken the threat very seriously and called off any of its reporters’ further investigations into the story surrounding Georgina and her family.
