The family of the missing leader of IPOB has condemned Swiss Embassy in Abuja for allegedly denying travelling visa to members of the family invited by the UN to the 116th United Nations Human Rights Working Group on Enforced and Involuntary Disappearances.
Kanu’s brother Emmanuel said the family members were invited by UN as key witnesses of the alleged mass murder committed by the Nigerian security operatives that invaded the family compound September 14, 2017, during the Operation Python Dance ll by the Nigerian Army.
“key IPOB members who witnessed the genocide at Afaraukwu were also denied visas,” said Emmanuel.
He accused the Embassy of “conspiracy, collusion and unholy dealings with Abuja to frustrate the family and help the Nigerian state escape punishment.”
He lamented what he called bad faith of the Swiss Embassy in constituting itself to an impediment to the family’s bid to get justice over the unprovoked invasion of the family house and the disappearance of their beloved ones.
Kanu’s parentd Eze Israel Kanu, the traditional ruler of Afaraukwu community and his wife, Lolo Sally Kanu have disappeared since last September.
“For the fact that you house the world body does not give you the right to deny victims and key eyewitnesses of torture and genocide visas even when the same world body invited them,” Emmanuel said.
He appealed to the UN as well as the United States of America and others to change their decision and issue visas to the invitees.
