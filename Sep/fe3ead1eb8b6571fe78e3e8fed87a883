Liverpool have emerged as a frontrunner to challenge for the Premier League this season after registering six out of six wins in their start to the campaign, bettering the record of rivals Manchester City and Chelsea.
If Liverpool are to win against Chelsea this weekend, they would stretch their winning streak to seven and break a Premier League record – setting a new milestone in the process.
The current Premier League record for a club’s best start to the season is six consecutive wins, which is what Liverpool have equalled. Liverpool are also the only Premier League team this season to have registered a 100% win-rate – with Chelsea and Manchester City also unbeaten in the league, but having succumbed to a draw each.
Newcastle United set the record in the 1994-95 season with six straight opening wins, a record which was then equalled by Man City and Chelsea in subsequent years.
