Mallam Ibrahim Shekarau, former Governor of Kano State, on Friday finally dumped the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, and defects to the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC.
Shekarau held a closed-door meeting on Friday in Kano State with APC National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole, and Governor Abdullahi Ganduje, after which he declared his defection to the ruling APC. .
Shekarau, speaking on his defection, noted that he believes that given by the current state of the political situation in Nigeria, it is important he moves to the APC.
Oshiomhole speaking in Kano after the closed-door meeting remarked that they discussed the defection of the former governor and the areas where they may need to make adjustments to properly accommodate Shekarau and his loyalists.
National Daily learnt that Shekarau may have succumbed to the tempting offers made to him by the Kano State Government which include feeling the vacancies created by the exit of Senator Musa Kwankwaso’s men, including the deputy governor. However, other political issues may have also influenced Shekarau’s decision to quit PDP and align with APC from where he defected to the PDP after Kwankwaso had defected to the APC from the PDP.
