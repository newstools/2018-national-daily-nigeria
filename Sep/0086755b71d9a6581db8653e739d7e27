Kylian Mbappe admits ‘I’d take a Paris Saint-Germain-Juventus Final now’ in the Champions League.
PSG President Nasser Al-Khelaifi had already sounded out Juve as his club’s biggest rivals in the Champions League, and Mbappe seemed to agree with him.
“Our group is complicated, but it’s the very nature of the Champions League to want it because it’s the most coveted trophy by the biggest European teams,” the France forward told Gazzetta delllo Sport.
“Against Napoli it’ll be tough. Ancelotti’s teams play good football with a precise philosophy, pressing high. They also have fantastic fans.
“Even though my memory isn’t so pleasant, I lost 5-0 to them with Monaco in a 2016 friendly.
“I know what I’m talking about. If you fall asleep in the field, I’m certainly not the one to wake you up. If we want to win, we’ll have to give our best.
“Cristiano Ronaldo at Juventus? First of all, he brought Italian football to the fore. Serie A has always been a great League, but lately it had lost a bit of prestige.
“With Ronaldo, people will get passionate about it again. I’d already been following Serie A, but now I do so with more interest.
“Ronaldo brings something great to Juventus. The Bianconeri weren’t that far away from being complete. That was shown by their Finals played in recent seasons without Ronaldo.
“With him, however, Juve have even more strength in their ranks. All the big teams will have to study the Bianconeri with more attention now.
“It’s also a great opportunity for Ronaldo, so it’s a win-win for both parties. And together they can do something great in the Champions League.
“A PSG-Juve Final? I’d take it now.”
