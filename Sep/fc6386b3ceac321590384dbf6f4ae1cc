 Tottenham goalkeeper Hugo Lloris has been banned from driving for 20 months and fined £50,000 after pleading guilty to drink-driving,National Daily gathered.

The court was told the 31-year-old provided a sample containing 80 micrograms of alcohol per 100 millilitres of breath, more than twice the legal limit in England and Wales.

An unmarked police car had spotted Lloris – who captained Les Bleus to World Cup glory in Russia on July 15 – as he drove his Porsche Panamera in the early hours, with prosecutor Henry Fitch claiming the player went through a red light before being stopped,National Daily learnt.

Fitch also told the court that police saw Lloris driving at 15mph in a 30mph zone, and veering towards parked cars before correcting himself.

He featured in Spurs’ first game after his initial arrest – a 3-0 victory at Manchester United – but was left out of the squad for the following game against Watford due to injury.
