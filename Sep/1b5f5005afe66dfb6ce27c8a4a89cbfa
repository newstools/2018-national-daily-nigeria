Former chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has declared intention to contest in the state’s governorship election.
Nuhu Ribadu is contesting on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC), after his first short when he defected to the PDP in 2015.
By early Saturday, Mr Ribadu’s supporters began to fill up from the Yola Airport to the ever-busy Galadima Aminu Way in the heart of Jimeta, venue of the declaration.
After addressing a mammoth crowd of supporters in the campaign office, he trekked to the party’s secretariat where he declared his intention to vie for the office of the governor.
Speaking at the secretariat, Mr Ribadu said he was overwhelmed by the turnout, which, he said, was indicative of people’s desire for change in the state.
He lambasted the state government for what he called its failings in addressing the aspirations and needs of the people.
He told his supporters that if given the chance to lead the state, he will provide an all-inclusive leadership devoid of deceit and lies.
Mr Ribadu said Adamawa is in need of a leadership that will provide holistic development and change the face of governance in the state.
Speaking on behalf of the youth who participated in the rally, Sadiq Jacob, said the decision by the youth of Adamawa state to support Mr Ribadu was hinged on the need for someone with good track record and capacity.
“We are sure Ribadu will not deceive us. We are sure he will not cheat us and believe he is here to salvage the state,” he said.
