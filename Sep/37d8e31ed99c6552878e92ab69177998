The FC Barcelona third kit for the 2018/19 season, designed by Nike, continues with its bold and beautiful celebration of the city of Barcelona.
Available from Wednesday 12 September on nike.com and at official stores and select retailers, features a dynamic sash design inspired by one of the Catalan city’s most famous streets, the Avinguda Diagonal, cutting an angular swathe from the left shoulder to right hem.
The two-tone shirt, with the darker red of the sash and its surrounding graphic gradually giving way to a paler pink shade completes the set of new strips for the new season, which ooze Barça DNA and are inspired by the city where the club is based.
The 10 vertical stripes on the home kit celebrate the 10 principal districts of the city, while the volt yellow away kit evokes memories of a famous 2005-06 campaign and underlines the club’s adventurous spirit. With a pattern based on an aerial view of Barcelona’s famous Eixample district and its blocks, the third strip gives an extra special connection back to the city’s landscape.
