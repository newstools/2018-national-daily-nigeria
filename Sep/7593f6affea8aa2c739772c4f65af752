Katsina United Technical Adviser, Coach Biffo revealed recently that his team are well aware of the surprise AITEO Cup could spring and would not be underrating any opponent including Osun United FC
He told National Daily that the AITEO cup is full of surprises with a non-league side already eliminating an NPFL side.
“Osun United if you look at their record for the past five to six years usually get to the Quarter-final or semi-final and at the moment, the team has a coach with a wealth of experience to manage a team.”
Osun United Technical Adviser, Duke Udi has managed teams like Sunshine Stars FC and Giwa FC in the past leading both teams to semi-final of the FA cup (now AITEO Cup).
Coach Biffo “i remains optimistic that my team would use the AITEO Cup to secure the only remaining available ticket to the Continent ,but am certain that my team are not the only ones with such ambitions and as this would not be getting ahead of myself.”
On his team’s mentality ahead of the crucial game on Monday, he said, “This is the only chance to showcase our talents and quality to the people in Nigeria at large.
We would make sure to do our possible best to win on Monday. I am not boasting, but I guarantee you that come Monday Katsina United would win, all we need to do is prepare for that very well and play with the right mentality.”
Duke Udi enters the game on Monday with a rich resume and Coach Biffo and his Katsina United boys would need to be wary of Osun United FC considering the track records of the former Nigeria youths international in the AITEO Cup.
