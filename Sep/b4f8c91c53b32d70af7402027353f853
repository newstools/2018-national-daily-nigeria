Portuguese superstar Cristiano Ronaldo has announced intention to add more to the  two “CR7” hotels he opened in 2016.  One is in Lisbon and one in Funchal, his hometown and capital of the island of Madeira.
The two Portuguese hotels are set to be joined by three new outposts in 2020: Madrid, New York and Marrakech.
Like the other five hotels, the €60 million (£53m/$70m) venture in Paris will be a 50-50 investment between Ronaldo and the Portuguese hotel group Pestana.
“It is quite expected that the Pestana CR7 brand will move to Paris, one of the most visited cities in the world,” Ronaldo said in a press release.
Before he moves into the business world Ronaldo has plenty left to achieve on the field, with the Juve star recently earning the joint-top rating in the soon-to-be-released video game FIFA 19.
