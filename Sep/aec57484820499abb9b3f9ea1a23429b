Liverpool have made contact with the mother and agent of Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Adrien Rabiot, sources have told ESPN FC.
The Premier League side are very keen on Rabiot, especially if they can sign him on a free transfer.
Jurgen Klopp is a long-time admirer of Rabiot and tried to sign him when he was Borussia Dortmund coach.
Klopp has followed Rabiot’s progress very closely with another source telling ESPN FC the pair have already spoken on the phone to discuss a move.
The 23-year-old is in the final year of his contract in Paris and has, for the moment, rejected all the offers of a new deal from the club who are still hoping to convince Rabiot to pen a new contract.
Rabiot was linked heavily with Barcelona over the summer but PSG refused to sell him. However, from January, he will able to sign on a free for another club for next season and is likely to be in demand.
Liverpool know they will face tough competition, with Barcelona going back for the player too, but Rabiot has never hidden his attraction to Liverpool.
Last October, in an interview with French radio station RMC, Rabiot said that he grew up loving Liverpool.
“I would love to play in the Premier League, not necessarily one club in particular, even though I was very fond of Liverpool when I was young,” he said.
