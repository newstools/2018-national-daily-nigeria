Top members of the APC have sealed a pact with SDP candidate Iyiola Omisore against the governorship rerun in Osun Thursday.
Party Chairman Adams Oshiomhole, Kano Gov. Abdullahi Ganduje, Gov.-Elect Kayode Fayemi, and Information Minister lai Mohammed met with Omisore early Wednesday morning in the Osogbo, and the report following the meeting was said to be positive.
“Chief Iyiola Omisore has agreed to work with the APC in Thursday’s rerun,”TheCable quoted a member of the APC as saying.
“The deal was sealed after a meeting with chief Omisore and the APC team led by chairman Adams Oshiomhole in Osogbo early Wednesday.”
The PDP had earlier made its effort to court the second runner up in the Saturday contest that saw PDP candidate Ademola Adeleke came marginally first ahead of the APC candidate Goyega Oyetola with 353 votes.
The victory margin warranted the Thursday rerun.
Senate President Bukola Saraki met with Omisore on Monday, and he too was optimistic the SDP candidate will play ball.
