Sanjoanense Atletico Clube, a Lusitanian football club founded in 1972, sent a letter to Juventus with recipient Cristiano Ronaldo. Reason? the company wants Cristiano Ronaldo in its ranks, but Junior, the son of the Portuguese ace.
And, since 2020, Mateo, Eva and Alana, the other three sons of the champion, are ready to welcome. Even the Sanjoanense would be ready to change the name of the stadium, from Campo Capa Rota in ‘Campo Cristiano Ronaldo’.
Here is the letter. “The Sanjoanense Atletico Clube, historical club of the Associaçao de Futebol de Coimbra, wants to proudly invite its son, Cristiano Ronaldo Junior, to be part of his football school.In our school all the teams are made up of males and females, from 3 to 10 years, this is why we take advantage to express our desire to welcome also his son Mateo and his daughters Eva and Alana from 2020. We see Cristianinho as a boy with an extraordinary talent for football and we believe we can strengthen and elevate him, even him, to the best player in the world, but above all aspects that highlight values that we like to convey to our little athletes, such as dedication, team spirit, ambition, humility, fair play and friendship … As a counterpart to our proposal, we offer the change of name of our stadium which would become the ‘Campo Cristiano Ronaldo’ “.
