Bimo FC proprietor Chinedu Okoye, has accused the management of the Nigeria National League of match fixing to favour Remo Stars gain promotion to the Nigeria Professional Football League.
To avoid conflict of interest, he argued, Bet9ja who sponsored the NNL, do not have the moral right to have a team in the same league they sponsored.
He opined that the reason NNL rushed back to restart the league after the world cup break, despite several complains of lack of funds from the league body as well as clubs in the NNL is to fix matches in making sure Remo Stars get promoted to the NPFL as a pay back for the league sponsor.
“The league body want to pay the sponsor back by promoting Remo stars to the NNL, and that was why there were lots of questionable officiating and allegations of match-fixing in the league because a particular team need promotion.”
“They started the league in a hurry because they want Remo stars to finish at least second on the log to gain promotion to the NPFL by crook.”
He also accused the Nigeria Football Federation of being a party to it.
“What kind of safe play do you expect from from such league? And NFF is not saying anything. If you ask them, they will say they have sponsor. Bet9ja that owns Remo stars is sponsoring a league ad you’re proud that you have a leagus with sponsor.”
Recently, Uefa rejected the sponsor of the Uefa Europa league by Red bull simply because Red bull owns two teams (RB Leipzig and Red Bull Salzburg) that are participating in this season’s Uefa Europa cup. According to Uefa the sponsorship deal was turned down to avoid conflicts of interest.
