The former Gunners star has confirmed his interest in filling the Porcupine Warriors’ vacant coaching role
Former Arsenal defender Emmanuel Eboue has confirmed reports that he is interested in becoming Ghana Premier League giants Asante Kotoko’s new head coach.
With the Porcupine Warriors in hunt for a new boss following the resignation of Paa Kwesi Fabin few days ago, Eboue believes he has the potentials to turn around the club’s fortunes when given the mandate.
The 35-year-old was handed his first coaching job in December last year by former club Galatasaray to handle the under-14 side.
“I will be very happy if I coach Kotoko [since they don’t have a coach now] or gets their youth team,” Eboue told Ashh FM.
“That is my dream. I want to send my CV to the club since I can change the fortunes of Kotoko especially their youth side.
“I have known Kotoko for a long time and was monitoring them when I was playing for Arsenal in the Premier League. I also know how the fans react if they lose a matches at home. I can stand any pressure.
“Ghana has so many talents but how to use them has been a problem so I’m ready to help,” he added.
Goal understands that 27 coaches have officially applied for the job including C.K Akonnor and Yussif Abubakar.
