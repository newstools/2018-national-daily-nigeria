Former Minister of Information Jerry Gana has declared his intention to run for presidency in 2019.
The SDP candidate said on Thursday he is joining the contest because President Muhammadu Buhari’s government has “failed to live up to its promises to Nigerians”.
The former minister said this in Abuja on Thursday while addressing journalists and supporters at the national secretariat of the Social Democratic Party where he went to purchase the N1m expression of interest form.
He told journalists at the party’s headquarers in Abuja where he went to pick up the N1 million- form that the tension in the country has not been this intense since the end of the civil war in 1970.
“With the utmost sense of responsibility and honour, I hereby express my well-considered interest to aspire as the presidential candidate of the SDP, with a view to ultimately contest in the forthcoming presidential elections in 2019,” he said.
“Being a patriotic and committed democrat who has carried a burden for the rapid, effective and even development of our dear nation for decades, I am deeply concerned with the very real prospect of Nigeria imploding unless our great party comes to the rescue with a God-fearing, dynamic leadership.
“Nigeria is facing an existential threat, the seriousness and proportion of which have never been witnessed since the end of the civil war.”
He promised to effectively tackle the security challenges in the country if he becomes president.
