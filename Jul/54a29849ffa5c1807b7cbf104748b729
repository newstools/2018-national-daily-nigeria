President Muhammadu Buhari early this week communicated to the Senate a fresh list of nominees for Board appointments, which include Dr. Muiz Banire SAN, former National Legal Adviser of the All Progressives Congress (APC), for screening and confirmation. The President in the request, designated Banire for appointment as Chairman of the Governing Board of the Assets Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON).
Banire was among the members of the national Working Committee (NWC) of the APC who went down with former APC national Chairman, Chief john Odigie-Oyegun, and not considered for re-election for another tenure. The appointment makes up for his removal from the APC NWC.
National DailyÂ gathered that President Buhari further appointed the 13 others who include chairman and 12 commissioners of the Federal Civil Service Commission.
The President of the Senate, Dr. Abubakar Bukola Saraki, read the letter containing the name of the nominees by the President to the lawmakers in the Upper Chamber of the national Assembly at the plenary on Tuesday seeking approval of the nominees for appointments.
