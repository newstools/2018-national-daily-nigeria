Telegraph report that David Ospina and Denny Welbeck are two Gunners who are likely to fall victims of Arsenal trimming the squad,National Daily gathered.
Unai Emery already spent around £70 million on five senior signings and the club are now focused on cleaning the house.
After Bernd Leno arrived from Bayer Leverkusen Arsenal have too many goalkeepers in the squad which means that a senior goalkeeper is likely to leave and the expectation is that it will be Ospina.
Welbeck is also now in the final year of his contract. He has scored only 27 goals across four years at Arsenal but did play 43 games last season after being disrupted previously by a knee injury.
