Diego Simeone rates Lionel Messi as a superior player to Cristiano Ronaldo despite believing the Juventus star is the better man for a bad situation,National Daily learnt.
A recording of Simeone stating his preference for Ronaldo emerged in the aftermath of Argentina’s shock 3-0 loss to Croatia at the World Cup.
“If I had to choose between Messi and Ronaldo then most likely I would choose Messi,” Simeone told reporters.
“When I talked about Messi and Ronaldo it wasn’t from the perspective of who is the best in the world.
“I just meant that if you have the chance to sign one of them for a normal club, with normal players, Ronaldo would probably fit in better.
“But with Messi, surrounded by great players, Messi is better than Ronaldo.”
