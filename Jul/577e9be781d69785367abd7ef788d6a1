Players of Niger Tornadoes are unhappy over what was alleged that last yearâ€™s AITEO Cup Runners up price money has been paid to the club management,National Daily learnt.
Nobody from the management is telling us (players) anything as regards the money even when we asked.
We want to know how true is it if the money has been paid or not. We call on the NFF to clarify if the money has been remitted to the club, a close source disclosed.
