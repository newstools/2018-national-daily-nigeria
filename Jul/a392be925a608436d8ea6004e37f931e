Juventus are reportedly keen on a reunion with Paul Pogba, and in order to secure one it’s been claimed that they are ready to try and raise £200m from player sales.
The Bianconeri confirmed a deal to sign Cristiano Ronaldo earlier this summer, which will cost them in excess of €100m, as per their statement.
By signing the 33-year-old, not only does it give them a major boost in their attempt to maintain their domestic dominance which extends to seven straight Serie A titles, but it could also be the catalyst to end their wait for success in Europe, with their last triumph dating back two decades ago.
Ronaldo arguably gives them a three or four-year window to win the Champions League while he’s still in his prime as given his history and pedigree in the competition, he thrives in it and could make a huge impact.
In turn, that perhaps plays a part in this rumour with The Mirror claiming that they could consider selling Miralem Pjanic, Gonzalo Higuain, Daniele Rugani and Mattia Caldara in order to make around £200m which would then go towards putting together a package for Pogba.
The French international emerged as one of the top midfielders in Europe during his previous stint in Turin, playing alongside Andrea Pirlo and Arturo Vidal and emerging as a star for Juve.
Adding him to a side also containing the likes of Ronaldo, Paulo Dybala and Giorgio Chiellini could give Juve and coach Massimiliano Allegri the tools required to have their best shot at European glory.
However, they must be cautious too as losing the quartet named above could be damaging and leave them lacking quality and depth, particularly if they axe two of their defensive stars for the future in Rugani and Caldara.
With that in mind, it remains to be seen whether or not such an ambitious suggested strategy is put into action, while ultimately based on the Mirror’s report, it would all hinge on their ability to get the right offers for the quartet in question first before talks with Pogba can even begin.
