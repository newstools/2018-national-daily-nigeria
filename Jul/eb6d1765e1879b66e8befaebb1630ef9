Apart from aiming for a better outing this year, Antoine Harchard would love to experience the beautiful and exciting atmosphere inside the Molade Okoya-Thomas Hall of the Teslim Balogun Stadium in Lagos.

I decided to return this year because it will afford me the opportunity to have a good result as I felt very great last year.”
The Frenchman described the organization of the tournament as top-notch. “The last year’s edition of Nigeria Open was well organized and it was a very special atmosphere because the crowd was totally involved during the matches and I loved this kind of experience. This made me to play well and I am looking forward to same experience this year,” he said.
