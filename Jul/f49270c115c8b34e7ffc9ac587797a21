“On behalf of entire people of Birnin-Gwari and our association, Birnin-Gwari Vanguards for Security and Good Governance, we extends our heartfelt condolences to the their families and the Nigerian Police Force for this irreparable loss,” the statement read.




“We equally like to commend all security agencies for the difficult task of uprooting acts of terrorism, armed banditry and Kidnappings along Birnin-Gwari-Kaduna highways as well as Birnin-Gwari-Funtua road and indeed the Kamuku forest.
“We are calling of all peace-loving people of Birnin-Gwari to volunteer in assisting security agencies to unmask all evil elements across our territory and also give accurate information on all hideouts of these criminals.”
