The Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN ) have commended the management of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) for resuming pumping of petroleum products to the Ejigbo depot, Lagos.
Alhaji Ayo Alanamu, Chairman, IPMAN, Ejigbo Satellite Depot, gave the commendation in an interview in Lagos.
Pumping of products was suspended at the depot due to repairs on the Atlas Cove- Mosinmi- Ibadan – Ilorin pipeline, bringing about sectional failure emanating from frequent vandalism of the branches.
Alanamu said NNPC on July 8 resumed pumping of products including petrol to the depot, to avert fuel scarcity in the South-West, and to avoid the stress of going to load at the Apapa private depot.
Alanamu confirmed that his members actually commenced loading of products from the depot on July 9 to various fuel outlets in the state.
“We commend NNPC for the overhaul of the depot and completion of the storage tanks repairs, to boost products availability.
“Effective loading has commenced and we appeal to the management of the corporation to always carry marketers along whenever there are issues affecting the depot,” he said.
Alanamu said pumping of products to the Ejigbo depot would drastically reduce the number of trucks waiting to load in Apapa, as well as the chaotic traffic situation there.
He pledged the association’s collaboration with the corporation on pipeline surveillance and the crusade against oil theft within the system 2B network.
Alanamu said IPMAN’s executive would partner the Pipelines and Products Marketing Company (PPMC) Limited to ensure that members of the association promptly receive their allocations.
“We will support security agencies to win the war against oil theft. We all know the damage oil theft is causing to our economy as a country.
“Like every other responsible Nigerian, we will support every move to win the war,” said Alanamu.
