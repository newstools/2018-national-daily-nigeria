As the debate over the future of Gernot Rohr heats up, Barr Obikwelu Jude-Benjamin
(Anambra State Football Association Vice Chairman)
that Rohr is the man to take Nigeria to the next level ,National Daily gathered.
“Gernot Rohr must be retained if we want to progress our football beyond group stages.
We lost not to Technical deficiency but to lack of competence or inability of our boys to convert opportunities.
In both games we lost , we had wasted chances by our strikers all of which except Musa we wanderers in the field of play.
The 1st goal for Croatia was a deflection which could have gone out of play. Not Rohr’s fault.
The 2nd goal for Croatia was a barbaric defence blunder from Ekong not Rohr’s fault. The Ist goal of Argentina was from a more difficult angle than the lost chance by Eghalo.
From the same position Ighalo lost was where Musa scored our 1st goal against Iceland.” said the match commissioner and former referee
The Anambra State Vice Chairman faulted the commitment and enthusiasm of the players
“Our boys were not committed. I think they were just satisfied our aimed at just playing in a world cup for records. Rohr’s is still the best we have had in recent times save for Westerhof”
