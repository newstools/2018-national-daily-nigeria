Catholic Archbishop of Abuja John Cardinal Onaiyekan has declared that Nigerian bishops have lost confidence in the government of President Muhammadu Buhari.
He said they are hopeful God would give Nigerians a government that would do the right thing.
He spoke to journalists in Ilorin, the Kwara, during the ordination of Bishop Paul Olawoore of Ilorin the Catholic diocese on Friday.
According to the cardinal, the Buhari government has not lived up to its constitutional responsibility of securing lives and property in the country.
“One life lost is one life too many. It does not matter whether they are Christians, Muslims or nobody. Even one Muslim killed worries me as much as Christians killed.
“There are various reasons for wanting to kill. We should go to the root of that. That is the job of the government which it is not doing.
“This is why we bishops of Nigeria have said we have lost confidence in the present government. We look to God to give us a government that will do the right thing.”
He also urged politicians to avoid desperation and engaging in violence in their bid for political powers.
