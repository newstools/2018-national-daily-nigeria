Argentina coach Jorge Sampaoli has hit back at claims that he asked for Lionel Messi’s permission to bring Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero off the bench against Nigeria.
Video footage showed Sampaoli in conversation with Messi on the side of the pitch in the World Cup group game before Aguero was brought on as a second half substitute in the must win clash against Nigeria.
It was suggested that during the conversation the Argentina coach asked the Barcelona whether to make the change and the clip appears to show Sampaoli mouthing “Kun, Kun”, to his captain.
But, Sampaoli has refuted those claims, saying: “We looked at different options in an important game and had to make a decision.

“It was a simple exchange I had with one of my players, that is all.”
Reports before the game suggested Aguero was dropped for Argentina’s final group game after a bust up with Sampaoli following the defeat to Croatia.
