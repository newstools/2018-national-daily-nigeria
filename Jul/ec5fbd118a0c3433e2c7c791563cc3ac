The reign of the bears continued unabated on the trading floor of the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE), even as virtually all the highly capitalized stocks joined the league of losers, causing investors’ wealth to fall by N142billion in three trading days.
According to analysts at Afrinvest Limited, the current bearish sentiment in the market is driven by some institutional investors reducing their positions in bellwethers stocks.
“Nevertheless, we believe an upturn in performance in the near term will be buoyed by bulk bargain hunting in some fundamentally sound stocks.”
Also, the Chief Research Officer at Investdata Consulting Limited, Ambrose Omodion, said investors are currently trading with caution because of fear of political risk, which he blamed for the apathy and low investors’ confidence in the market.
He added that foreign investors that play dominant role have resorted to massive selloff of shares in the market.
