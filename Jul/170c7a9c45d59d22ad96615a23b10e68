Thirteen of the 17 local government chairmen in the APC in Benue have cross over to the PDP, three days after Gov. Samuel Ortom joined the PDP.
Ortom had earlier hinted that a crowd of followers were waiting to follow him to the PDP.
No fewer than 13 local government chairmen and 276 councillors attended the meeting which held at the new banquet hall of the government house in Makurdi, the state capital.
The PDP is now the leading party in Benue, controlling two senatorial districts, 22 state constituencies, over 13 local government areas and the governorship seat.
Ortom was formerly in the PDP, serving as a junior minister under former President Goodluck Jonathan.
He defected to the APC before the 2015 election.
