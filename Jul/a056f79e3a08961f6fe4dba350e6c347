Chris Froome is reportedly set to be BANNED from competing in the Tour de France by race organisers,National Daily learnt.
The Brit, 33, would be aiming for a historic fifth triumph in the prestigious race.
Froome is allowed to compete in races despite being found to have too much Salbutamol in his system during the 2017 Vuelta a Espanya as the case – started in September 2017 – remains open.
But according to Le Monde, Team Sky will have to successfully appeal the organisers’ decision in order for him to line-up.
Team Sky expect Froome to be at the race, however.
A spokesman said: “We are confident that Chris will be riding the Tour as we know he has done nothing wrong.”
Amaury Sport Organization, who own the event, can use article 28 of its rules to prevent people from competing – they apparently sent Team Sky an email stating Froome would not be welcome at this year’s race.
