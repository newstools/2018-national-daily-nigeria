Cristiano Ronaldo has reportedly agreed to join Juventus after the Italian champions decided to pay the €100 million (£88m/$116m) release clause in his Real Madrid contract, according to O Jogo.
Juventus have analysed the financial aspects of signing the Portugal superstar and, in addition to the fee, are prepared to hand Ronaldo a four-year contract worth €120m (£101m/$140m).
Ronaldo’s relationship with Madrid president Florentino Perez has broken down amid a failure to agree a new contract and the 33-year-old has decided to join Juventus.
Real Madrid have agreed a staggering €272 million (£239m/$316m) deal with PSG to sign forward Kylian Mbappe, according to respected French journalist Baptiste Ripart .
The Champions League winners will apparently make four separate payments to the Ligue 1 champions for the France international, who helped send his country through to the World Cup quarter-finals with two goals against Argentina.
