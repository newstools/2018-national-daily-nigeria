Governor Ayodele Fayose of Ekiti State was said to suffer temporary loss of consciousness on Wednesday after teargas was fired into Government House in Ado-Ekiti, by security operatives.
National Daily gathered that a combined team of security operatives from the Department of State Services (DSS) and Nigeria Police placed Ekiti State Government House under siege in the final stage of preparations to the Saturday governorship election in the state.
The reason for the heavy security surveillance at the Government House is still uncertain, while it was gathered that no one has claimed responsibility for the spreading of the teargas at the Government House.
National Daily gathered that Governor Fayose was urgently taken to the State House Clinic where doctors attended to him and he was revived.
The incidence was said to have heightened the fear of using the federal might to manipulate the Saturday governorship election and subvert the will of the people of Ekiti State.
Meanwhile, Fayose is being awaited to make an official statement on the incidence as soon as he settles down after recovery from the trauma.
The PDP Governorship candidate, Olusola Kolapo, as well as the State Chairman have urged the party supporters not to succumb to intimidation by the Army and Police deployed to the state by the federal government.
