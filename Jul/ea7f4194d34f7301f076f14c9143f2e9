Top officials of sports wear manufacturing and marketing company, NIKE, on Wednesday, delivered 24 boxes of NIKE branded kits to the Nigeria U-20 women’s team,  the falconets, at their training camp in Austria,National Daily gathered.
This is in fulfillment of an agreement reached with the Amaju Pinkick led NFF board during the official unveiling ceremony, of the Super Eagles world cup jersey held earlier this year in London.
Just last week, football fans back home were wondering why the Under-20 and Under Under-15 male teams that travelled to Mauritania and Algiers respectively for international engagements, were kitted in the old NIKE Jersey but the NFF was quick to explain that the delay in getting the kits across  has got to do with the lingering NFF crisis which has now been resolved with the fatherly intervention of president Mohammadu Buhari and the attorney general of the federation, Abubakar  Malami.
That action, has paved way for normalcy to return, prompting NIKE to swing into action with the delivery of the first batch of kits to Nigeria’s world cup bound under-20 women’s team.
The Falconets delegation of 25 players and officials,  departed Nigeria on Friday last week and have since been intensifying preparation at their base camp in Austria, ahead of the Under-20 Women’s world cup, starting August this year, in France,National Daily learnt
