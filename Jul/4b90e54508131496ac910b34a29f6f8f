Supporters of PDP governorship aspirant in Osun, Akin Ogunbiyi, are protesting the alleged manipulation of the Saturday primary election of the party which favoured Senator Ademola Adeleke.
Carrying placards with inscroptions in solidarity with Ogunbiyi, the protesters claimed that he was the winner of the primary election.
The protesters are hoping the PDP will lose the guber election if the fraud is not addressed.
They said the crisis will make the guber contest a walkover for the ADC candidate Gboyega Oyetola if he has to contest with Adeleke.
