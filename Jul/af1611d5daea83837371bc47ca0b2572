Super Eagles World Cup sensation Ogenekarol Etebo has vehemently denied writing or signing any petition against Warri Wolves over outstanding monies owed  some players by the club.
According to a newspaper report,Etebo, Daniel Akpeyi and other ex Warri Wolves players  had written a petition to the Economic and Financial Commission demanding payments of monies owed them  under the leadership of current NFF President  Amaju Pinnick.
“I have never complained about money to anyone,neither did I sign any petition. This story is meant to create distractions and confusion. I don’t want anyone to use my name to create confusion. I want to concentrate on my career,” he said.
He affirmed that he had instructed his lawyer to take up the matter by demanding an apology.
“The publication has brought tension to the extent that my wife had to call me after buying the paper. The publication is not only untrue ,but misleading. I think they just wanted to use my name and Akpeyi to score a point ,but it is not fair at all.”
