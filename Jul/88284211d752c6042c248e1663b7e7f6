Real Madrid and Man United are set to do battle this summer in the race to snag a deal for England and Leicester City star Harry Maguire.
This is according to Don Balon, who note that both sides are in for the player, and that Leicester have an asking price of €90M on the head of Maguire, a price that seems quite ridiculous to say the least.
The report also states that the Real boss Julen Lopetegui wants to sign Maguire as he wants to add to his side’s ability in aerial situations, something that the Englishman would definitely help do.
Maguire was absolutely sensational for England at the World Cup in Russia this summer, with his displays playing a big part in helping the Three Lions reach the semi finals.
The Leicester man was almost unbeatable in the air from set piece situations, something that Gareth Southgate took full advantage of.
Maguire picked himself up both a goal and an assist at the tournament, both of which came from corners, as England shocked everyone by finishing fourth overall.
Maguire would be a great signing for either Madrid or United, however paying the Foxes asking price of €90M would not be a wise move from either side.
Maguire has only had one good season in the Premier League and one good tournament for England, something that probably doesn’t warrant forking out that much for his signature.
