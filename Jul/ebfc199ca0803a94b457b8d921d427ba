There is heavy Police presence at the official residence of the President of the Senate, Dr. Abubakar Bukola Saraki, in the early hours of Tuesday. As early as 7.30am, heavily armed policemen cordoned off all entrance and exit routes to the Senate President’s residence, restricting movement of persons and vehicles.
The Senate President was on his way out for official duty at the National Assembly when the Police blocked his convoy. Saraki was to proceed from the National Assembly to Force Headquarters, Abuja, to  honour the Police invitation on the case of Ofa robbery incident which the Police said Saraki has a case to answer, when he suddenly found that the Police has taken over everywhere around his residence. This has restricted the movement of the Senate President.
It is not yet certain whether the Police are placing Saraki on house arrest or they are there to effect outright arrest of the Senate President.
The Police had invited Senate President Saraki to report to the Headquarters Abuja to answer to allegations of being linked to the Offa bank robbery on the  claim that one of the suspects arrested and being interrogated mentioned him in his confession.
As the invitation generated public uproar of political persecution, the Police authorities later accepted written statement from Saraki without his appearance at eth Force Headquarters.
Saraki had in that statement denied any knowledge or link with the Offa bank robbery.
As the crisis in the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) deepens, and the progressive Reformed All Progressives Congress (R-APC) bloc in the APC which Saraki belong threatens ultimate showdown, including defection from the APC, the Police resume Saraki’s invitation on the Offa bank robbery incident which he had already written a statement.
National Daily is following the development, more details later.
