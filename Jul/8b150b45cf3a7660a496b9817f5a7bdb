Senate President Bukola Saraki is now in the Senate chamber for the day’s plenary.
He came in at 10:40a.m., after reporting to the Force headquarters  following a siege on his convoy early Tuesday morning.
But  Deputy Senate President Ike Ekweremadu, whose Abuja home was also sealed off by the police and DSS, is not yet in the chamber.
Ekweremadu’s house was still on at 10:50 a.m.
Saraki has said his invitation by the police was politically motivated.
