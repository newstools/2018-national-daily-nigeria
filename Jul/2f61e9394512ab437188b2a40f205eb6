Chelsea attacker Eden Hazard has agreed a move to Barcelona, according to a report.
The 27-year-old has two years remaining on his current contract at Stamford Bridge and has not yet committed to a new deal.
Hazard has also publicly stated that he will not rule out a move away from West London unless the uncertainty over their managerial situation is resolved.
Real Madrid have been linked with Hazard but, according to Transfermarketweb, the Belgium international has reportedly agreed to sign for the Catalan giants and will move in a Â£80m deal.
Hazard is currently at the World Cup with the Red Devils, where he will contest the third-place playoff against England on Saturday.
