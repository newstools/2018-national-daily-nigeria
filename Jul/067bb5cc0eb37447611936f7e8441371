Eyitayo, a 3-old year has been declare missing following the tanker explosion that rocked the Otedola bridge end of the Lagos-Ibadan expressway where nine lives were lost and over 50 vehicles burnt.

Hours after the incident, a post with Eyitayo’s picture went viral on social media— informing the public that the boy and the driver could not be found.

According to the post, Eyitayo was involved in the unfortunate tanker explosion which occurred at Otedola Bridge, Berger, Lagos on 28th June 2018 with his mother, twin sister and driver named Mr. Joseph. They were a few cars away from the tanker when the explosion occurred.

“The driver (Mr Joseph) carried Eyitayo while the mother escaped with Eyitoke (Eyitayo’s twin). However, the whereabouts of Eyitayo and Mr Joseph is still unknown as all attempts to trace them at the scene of the accident proved abortive,” the post read.

On Friday, a few persons wrote on social media that he had been found. Efforts to reach Eyitayo’s mother on Saturday was abortive as her line was switched off.

However, Eyitayo aunt, Funmi Balogun, when contacted said the boy is still missing. “We have not found him,” Balogun answered in a weary tone. “One person posted that he has been found. We have not seen him.”

Balogun had accused the officials of not telling them anything. “We were there this morning again, nothing,” she said.
 
When contacted, Adebayo Kehinde, head, public affairs unit of the Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA), said his office does not know the whereabouts of the boy.

“For me, I don’t have any details concerning the boy,” Kehinde said. “We don’t have any details in my office.”

Chike Otti, Lagos police command spokesperson, was not available for comment.
