Nigeria-born striker Rasheed Omokafe Richard who had a victorious season with his former club Magusa Turk Gucu FC in Cyprus won the International Striker of the year recently at the Cool  Wealth  Award 2018.
The former player at the Naga World Football Club  in Cambodia told National Daily that he is very grateful for the award
“I am feeling great because my former team is of a better standard compared to the old one. And they were the runners-up in Cyprus league said Omokafe.
The Lagos-born player said he is a free player at the moment, hoping to get connection to any Europe side for the new season .
Before his forage abroad on a limb, Omokafe featured in some competitions like the Challenge Cup, Badagry League, Oba Ojora Cup, Boska, Ojor Cup in Kwara State (Lafa league).
After that, his effort to ride on the tail of some agents abroad was fruitless until he made it out to Cambodia on his own, and later to Cyprus.
Although playing in Europe is his dream, Omokafe claims he still loves his fatherland.
“I will love to play for my great country soonest,” the 24-year-old said.
