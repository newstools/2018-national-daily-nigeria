There is rising uproar over the circulation of a conflicting final result of the Saturday, July 14, 2018, governorship election in Ekiti State being linked to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). The conflicting result is being streamlined to the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), and denoted as ‘official report of the Ekiti State gubernatorial election of Saturday, 14th, 2018, as announced by INEC.’ The report indicated that INEC declared total votes cast as 316, 019, attributed the wining votes of 197,459 to Dr. Kayode Fayemi of the APC, and 178,114 to Olusola Kolapo of the PDP, generating concerns over perceived 59,554 votes discrepancy. The aggregate votes of both the APC and PDP was calculated to be 375,573 indicated to exceed the 316,019 total votes claimed to be declared by INEC.
However, cross checking the INEC record, the Commission declared total votes cast of 403,451; total valid votes 384,594, rejected votes 18,857, total number of accredited votes 405,861 and total number of registered voters 909,585.
The graphic election report is fast being given prominent attention on the social media, raising questions about the transparency of the election.




INEC may need to clarify the controversy before it goes beyond control.
