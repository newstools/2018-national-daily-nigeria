 A Catholic priest of the Sacred Heart Parish in Obomkpa, Delta State, Reverend Andrew Anah, has been kidnapped for a second time by gunmen.
National Daily gathered that the Reverend Anah was kidnapped in 2017 and was released after alleged payment of undisclosed amount of ransom to the kidnappers.
It was further gathered that indigenes of the community complained that the Obomkpa, Ukwu-Nzu and now Onicha Olona Axis of Aniocha North have been notorious for high frequency of kidnapping; pointing out that the area is the same zone the reverend was kidnapped the first time. However, it was indicated that the circumstances of the fresh kidnap are still hazy.
It was disclosed that previous victims of kidnapping in the area include the Managing Director of a construction company, as well as the Chairman of the Aniocha North Traditional Rulers’ Committee, Obi Sunday Olisenweokwu.
Delta State Police Public Relations Officer, Andrew Aniamaka, was said to have confirmed the kidnap incidence on Thursday, acknowledging that this is the second time the same priest is being kidnapped.
The Police, however, assured that the Force will do everything to ensure that the culprits are brought to justice and the victim is rescued.
