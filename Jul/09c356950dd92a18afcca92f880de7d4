Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) lawmakers in the Benue State House of Assembly on Monday announced the suspension of seven All Progressives Congress (APC) lawmakers.
The PDP lawmakers, numbering 19, are suspending the APC lawmakers for court contempt and for holding illegal plenary.
The PDP lawmakers during their plenary at the old banquet hall of the Government House in Makurdi, Benue State capital said the plenary by the APC lawmakers is illegal as they have disregarded the restraining order  against the former speaker, Terkimbi Ikyange and his executives.
The PDP lawmakers have also called on the international community to intervene in the crisis rocking the Benue State House of Assembly.
This suspension comes few hours after APC lawmakers, during their plenary at the State House of Assembly, moved a motion for the impeachment of Governor Samuel Ortom over alleged diversion of state funds and abuse of office.
Earlier on Monday, police officers stormed the Benue State House of Assembly preventing 22 PDP lawmakers from gaining access to the complex.
A Benue State High court, last week, gave an order restraining the impeached speaker of the Benue State House of Assembly, Terkimbi Ikyange, from parading himself as the Speaker of the House.
The Chief Judge of Benue State, Justice Adam Onum, on Friday, granted an ex parte order of interim, restraining the impeached speaker.
Also, his Deputy, James Okefe Ejembi and the former Majority leader, Benjamin Tilley Adanyi, were ordered by the court to stop parading themselves as principal officers of the state assembly, pending the determination of a suit filed by the 22 lawmakers.
