The Lagos State University (LASU) said that it had curtailed activities of cult groups within its campuses.
The Registrar of the institution, Mr Olayinka Amuni said that the activities of such groups were no longer traceable.
Amuni said that the university was lucky to have recently admitted sets of students who were not attracted to vices.
“We have been very lucky recently to have students who are not attracted to vices, and have been able to curtail the activities of cultists within our campuses.
“I can’t remember us having cases of students sanctioned for cultism. There may be cases of other negative engagements but not in terms of cultism,” he said.
According to him, the university’s curriculum has been designed to make students busy.
“Our students know that except they use their time positively on their academics, they may be on their way out of the system.
“This is because we do not indulge in allowing students to continue to fail,” he said.
Amuni said that the institution also encouraged students to engage in extra curricular activities such as sports to engage them positively.
The registrar said that LASU had also strengthened its counselling unit, and would continue sensitisation of students to the consequences of cultism.
Amuni said that LASU would not hesitate to sanction students flouting its rules to serve as a deterrent to others.
