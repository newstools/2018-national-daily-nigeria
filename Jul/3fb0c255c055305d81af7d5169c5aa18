A 26-year-old lady who lost her father at a young age and had to live at the mercy of relatives, has cried out after her 36-year-old uncle brutalized her in Abuja.
Maimuna Muhammed revealed that her father’s relatives collected all they had after her father died and her mother was forced to move back to her family with her children.
But she had to endure insults from her brothers’ wives even though she was solely responsible for her children’s upkeep.
According to Comfort Empowerment and Advocacy Foundation, Maimuna had enough of the insults thrown at her mum and decided to stand up for her mum.
This led to her being brutally beaten by her mum’s younger brother.
Sharing photos of her bruised skin and uncle Abdulmajeed who battered her, Maimuna wrote she was being grateful to her mum’s family for accepting them as the mother didn’t re-marry even though she was 100% responsible for school fees, feeding, clothing of her and her siblings.
“We have watched our mum take no decision for us without her immediate families consent, we’ve watched our mum been insulted by the wives of her brothers and we did or said nothing.
“But today I was beaten this much by my mum’s younger brother, the one who lived under our roof while my dad was still alive and even after his death, one that all d days his lived with us he has never helped my mum carry a cup of water?”
The reason for the beating was because Memuna said enough was enough–that 23 years of tolerance must end.
“The person that did this to me is 36 years old, a man I loaned money when he needs, a man that calls me late at night to make him quick nooddles
“I know my social status but I just have to post this as if it concerns my mother . I will put my life on the line and this will not stop me. “
