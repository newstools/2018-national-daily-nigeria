Rev. Chris Okotie of the Household of God Church, Lagos, says at this state of Nigeria’s political decadence, the country needs a leader like him, who can transform the dreams and aspirations of Nigerians into reality.

Subsequently, the charismatic pastor while declaring his intention to run for the office of the President, asked the two leading political parties in the country, the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP) to as a matter of urgency adopt him as their consensus candidate for the 2019 presidential election.

In a letter addressed to the national chairmen of the two parties and made available to National Daily on Sunday, Rev. Okotie, said Nigeria needs a man who is credible, dependable and trustworthy.

According to him, the current democracy has been hijacked by elitism, mysticism and satanism. “Nigeria is in dire need of restructuring. Our federalism is simply terminological inexactitude and a realistic piece of fakery.”

“My mandate, therefore, will be to set up an interim government which I have christened  Government of National Reconciliation and Reconstruction as the mechanical instrumentality for the crystallization of the new Nigeria of our dreams.”

” I appeal to the APC and the PDP to subscribe their support for this ideal by adopting me as a consensus presidential candidate at the next elections.

Rev. Okotie who besieged the political parties to do the right thing by adopting him said there is an intrinsic resilience embedded in the psyche of Nigerians which must now be summoned to strengthen the feeble hands of discouragement and re-ignite hope in the Nigerian fraternity.
