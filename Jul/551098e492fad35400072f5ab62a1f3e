Former Finance Minister Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala has been appointed to Twitter’s board of directors.
She was appointed alongside Robert Zoellick, chairman, board of directors of AllianceBernstein Holding, a global investment management firm.
Okonjo-Iweala’s appointment came after Marjorie Scardino stepped down from the Twitter board.
“Ngozi and Bob are distinguished leaders with unparalleled global perspective and policy expertise,” said Omid Kordestani, executive chairman of Twitter.
“We are confident they will be incredible assets to Twitter as we continue to focus on driving transparency and making Twitter a safer, healthier place for everyone who uses our service.
Okonjo-Iweala said she is “thrilled” to join the Twitter team.
“Twitter is a powerful platform that continues to be used as a strong connector for the global community, and I’m thrilled to be a part of the team,” she said.
“As we strive to build a better world for tomorrow, Twitter can amplify messages and drive critical conversations around today’s most important issues. I look forward to partnering with Twitter’s talented directors and leadership team as we work to leverage the power of Twitter for good.”
Zoellick was the World Bank president between 2007 and 2011 when Okonjo-Iweala was managing director.
