Department of State Services officers and men of the Nigeria Police cordoned off the Abuja homes of Senate President Bukola Saraki and Deputy Senate President Ike Ekweremadu.
The security men descended on the homes early on Tuesday.
But those deployed to Saraki’s Maitama residence, however, left around 7:30am when they learnt he was not on the premises.
Saraki, the National Daily gathered, had been invited by the police for interrogation over the Offa Bank Robbery complicity early in the year.
Ekweremadu’s house still remains  under siege.
Suspects of the robbery had named the No. 3 man among their sponsors, and Saraki had as at then not responded to the Force headquarters invitation for interrogation.
Many, however, believe the Tuesday development is a political gambit to hamstring Saraki suspected to be amongst the leader of the R-APC, a splinter group within the ruling party, scheming against President Muhammadu Buhari’s re-election in 2013.
