The Commissioner for Information in Abia, Chief John Okiyi, has said government’s plan to re-open Enyimba Stadium in Aba this month is no longer feasible,National Daily gathered.
Okiyi, made the disclosure in Umuahia on Friday while speaking to newsmen on the extent of job that has been carried out on playing turf.
He said 98 percent of the work which is worth One billion Euro had been completed.
The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the contract is being handled by a Bayelsa-based company,  Monimichelle Group.
The commissioner further hinted that the pitch was ready but the entire contract had only reached 80 per cent completion.
He added that the larger contract included the construction of tartan tracks and re-roofing of the stands.
However, Okiyi promised that Enyimba would return to the stadium in September, when the entire job would have been fully completed.
“Of course, the team needs to train and practice on the new turf for at least four months before hosting their home matches at the facility.
“But if the team can be made to play closed door, I can assure you that the pitch is ready for them because the contractor has completed his job by 98 per cent.
He disclosed that the Confederation of African Football (CAF) would inspect the facility and give its approval before it would be open for matches.
