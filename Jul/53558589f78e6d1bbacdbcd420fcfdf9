Festus Keyamu SAN, Counsel to the Amaju Pinnick led Nigeria football federation NFF, Executive committee, who also doubles as  chairman Buhari re-election campaign committee has left the president wondering if he didn’t make a mistake appointing the Plateau state-born politician, Solomon Dalung as Nigeria’s Sports Minister.
This was after Keyamo took time to explain to Mr president,  the implication of the ongoing NFF crisis and how it will negatively affect his second term re-election campaign,National Daily gathered.
President Buhari is one man who believe so much in the ability of all his ministers and will not want to Interfere in their activities but recent happenings in Nigeria football has made him seek intelligent advice and there is no better person to offer such, than Keyamo who has been at the Forefront of the battle to liberate Nigeria football from the hands of intruders.
Our very impeccable source at the villa informed this reporter that after listening to Keyamo, the president immediately sent a strong worded directive to Dalung, to seek a way out of the logjam and avoid any potential FIFA Ban for the good of Nigeria and himself.
Any Ban of whatever magnitude, will mean a monumental setback to Nigeria Football as Football  activities on the home front will be totally grounded leaving the innocent youths to rue the potential damage it will have on their football career.
