While speaking to our correspondent, the soft speaking DSSC boss said it is just a cheap blackmail because nothing of such happened.

Okowa advised  journalists to be professional at all time and watch out for quacks in the noble profession .
He pointed out that reporters should not be quick to publish story but should go for fact to spice their story content to gain more respect from the public.
