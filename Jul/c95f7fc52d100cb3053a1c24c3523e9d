Abia Warriors Football Club of Umuahia came from behind to beat visiting ASJ Academy of Owerri 4-1 in a friendly decided at the Umuahia Township Stadium recently, National Daily learnt.
The game was only five minutes old when former Abia Warriors apprentice, Elvis Okorafor out-jumped the Abia Warriors defenders to nod beyond Agbor Ekoi for the opening goal.
The young boys from Owerri had opportunities to further punish the home team but lacked the cutting edge and once the Warriors equalised midway in the half through Emeka Isaac who made no mistake from the spot after Paul Samson was hacked down in the 16-metre box, it became a one-way traffic.
Speedster, Cyril Idemokon scored twice within a space of three minutes including a wonderful free-kick to leave the scoreline 3-1 at the interval while second half substitute, Williams Chimezie netted Abia Warriors fourth, just a few minutes after his introduction.
Abia Warriors Head Coach, Emmanuel Deutcsh said later in an interview that the friendly games are organized to put the team in fine shape ahead of the resumption of the Nigeria Professional Football League adding that the technical crew was happy at the commitment of the boys.
