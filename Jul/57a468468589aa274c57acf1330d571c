Kwara state stadium complex, Ilorin seriously call for government’s attention before it  turn to gracing area,National Daily learnt.
The stage of Kwara state stadium complex, Ilorin is currently not safe as the environment is full of bush.
This development will encourage snakes and other dangerous animals to penetrate the area.
I use this medium to appeal to the appropriate authority before it cause damage or lost of life.
Prevention is better than cure and cleanliness is godliness.
