Former Head of State Gen. Yakubu Gowon (retd) has spoken out against the way the government is handling securityin Nigeria, saying the situation might degenerate to a religious war.
Gowon said this Saturday at the Benue People’s House, Makurdi, while visiting Governor Samuel Ortom to commiserate with the government and the citizens.
There have been killings and destruction of properties in the state since January, and innocent and unarmed villagers, according to Gowon, are being killed by armed herdsmen that the government could not stop.
Former Defence Minister Theophilus Danjuma had earlier hit at President Muhammadu Buhari and the Nigerian Army for handling with kid gloves the Benue killings by herdsmen.
And the former military president also said he was disappointed at the handling of the security situation in the country.
“Security agencies should invite and question the leadership of Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore who had threatened to unleash violence on Benue State and later justified the killings and their roles,” said the leader of Nigeria Prays, a group of Christians praying for the nation.
The presidency has described as crocodile tears the sentiments former leaders are expressing over increasing spates of killings across the north central and other parts of Nigeria.
Commiserating with the people, he said he was out of the country when two priests and 17 worshipers were killed in a church in the state during morning mass.
“I am sad and worried at the religious dimension the killings are assuming,” he said.
“It is worrisome to see innocent people being killed. Government should make more efforts to tackle the insecurity situation in the country before it descends into a full religious war.”
He then commended the governor for the way he has so far handled the issues of killings and devastation of communities.
