Former Manchester United goalkeeper Mark Bosnich urged the club to show patience with Jose Mourinho, telling the Red Devils not to be drawn into regular changes like rivals Liverpool.
In his second season in charge at Old Trafford, Mourinho failed to deliver a trophy, but United finished second behind record-breaking rivals Manchester City in the Premier League, National Daily learnt .
That came a campaign after Mourinho led United to a Europa League and EFL Cup double.
Bosnich, who had two spells at United, says the Portuguese tactician needs more time and the club should avoid following Liverpool’s lead, the Merseyside giants having made numerous changes in their bid to win a first league title since 1990.
“Just stand by him [Mourinho]. Give him the opportunity, he is second against a team in Man City who can afford anyone and get anything,” he told Omnisport and Goal.
“Like I said to you, sometimes, even after such dominance, you have got to be patient.
“You don’t want to fall in a situation like Liverpool, after all those years of dominance and then all of a sudden you want to chop and change.
“Stick with this guy, he is a winner and he will bring the glorious times back.”
“I feel privileged to work with such a fantastic group of boys.
