Sunshine Stars calls off strike, to resume training today as lethargic ODSFAÂ  pays the staff a miserly 1 month salary with no bonus,National Daily learnt.
The Ondo State Football Agency (which should be changed to the Ondo Football Lazy Football Agency in my opinion) has finally managed to scrap out a miserly 1 month salary for Sunshine Stars staff without bonus out of the mountainous backlog of about 10 months salaries and match bonuses
In keeping to their words, the players and staff on receiving the alerts yesterday suspended the strike momentarily and will resume training today ahead of the league which takes off on Wednesday
The ODSFA claims to still be paying players and staff that have long left the club, their own backlog of salaries via the LMC which is why the current players and staff must have to endure and adapt to excruciating penury, hunger and pain till the old batches of debts are cleared
If this claim is true, then it poses a great doubt over the transparency of the management of the LMC as well as another colossal failure to the never ending list of achievements (if you can call it that) of the Amaju Pinnick led administration in its inability to take care of the players or be bothered in the slightest.
