The General Overseer of Love Of Christ Generation Church Rev. Mother Esther Abimbola Ajayi has called on well-meaning Nigerians to support the initiative of the management of Buruj Sports Academy ahead of their upcoming trip to  the United Kingdom for the defense of the English Super Cup title they won in Manchester last year,National Daily learnt.
The 36-man contingent consisting of players, team officials, LTV crew and representatives of the Lagos State Football Association, are set to depart the shores of the country in the last week of this month (July)  for the tournament that will see football scouts and agents storm the venue to shop for emerging stars in the round leather game.
The highly revered clergywoman who has been championing the cause of unification amongst Christian faithful and denominations in Nigeria was of the view that there is need for more support from corporate bodies and individuals for the management and players of the academy so that they can be able to realise their lofty goals through participation in international competitions.
National Daily learnt that the London-based ‘Iya Adura 1’ as fondly called by church members and admirers has been a pillar of support for the academy following their triumph last year and has promised to do more but was quick to add that she cannot do it all alone,  hence the clarion call for others who are in position to assist the young players to join her in the quest to make sure that the players of the academy have a successful outing once again this year.
She is currently in the country to create awareness and shed more light on the rationale behind the sponsorship of many Nigerian citizens to the event -Celebrating Unity In Holy Spirit, which will hold in New York, USA, on Saturday, 28th of July
