Cristiano Ronaldo has released a letter to Real Madrid supporters following his switch to Juventus.
Here are his key quotes:
“I believe that the time has come to open a new stage in my life and that is why I have asked the club to accept transferring me. I feel that way and I ask everyone, and especially our followers, to please understand me.”
He thanks the club, his “fabulous” teammates and the fans.
“I have reflected a lot and I know that the time has come for a new cycle. I’m leaving but this shirt, this shield and the Santiago Bernabéu will continue to always feel as my own wherever I am.”
