Special Adviser to the Speaker of the House of Representatives on Special‎ Duties has resigned his membership of the APC.
Usman Bawa was a member of the House of Representatives where he represented Kaduna North Local Government Area at the ‎National Assembly.
He sent his signed resignation letter, dated July 14, to ‎the APC chairman in his local government.
Bawa was appointed by the Speaker of the House of Representatives Yakubu Dogara in 2015.
“I write to convey my decision to resign as a member of the All Progressive Congress ( APC) following consultations with my teaming supporters,” Bawa wrote.
“The decision has become imperative to enable me pursue other course of life. I seize this ‎opportunity to express my appreciation to the executives and members of APC for their support during my stint with the party.”
He did not mention the new party he will be joining.
Weeks ago, an aide to Senate President Bukola Saraki, Hakeem Baba-Ahmed from Kaduna, also left the APC.
Dogara and Saraki are still members of the APC, though many believe they are sponsors of the R-APC, a splinter group within the APC.
The rebel group is already aligning with the other parties including the PDP to form a coalition for the 2019 election.
