Former Arsenal striker Chioma Ubogagu has admitted that she would be open to playing for the Nigeria Women’s National Team, the Super Falcons.
Born in London, Chichi is eligible to represent England, United States and Nigeria at international level, but it is the Americans that are believed to be in pole position to secure her services at the moment.
The 25-year-old was a key member of the United States squad that won the 2012 Fifa U20 World Cup and was in action against the Falconets in a last four clash in Tokyo.
”I am always open to an opportunity. I am proud to be Nigerian. I am proud to be English. I am proud to be American.
”I think it’s an honour to represent one’s country, so if I ever earned that opportunity it is something I would consider and take very seriously.”
Now on the books of National Women’s Soccer League, Orlando Pride, Ubogagu played for Arsenal for one year in 2015 and during that time she established a good rapport with Super Eagles winger Alex Iwobi.
”I don’t think admire is the right word, but I know Alex Iwobi. I think he’s a good player, and he’s always been extremely nice to me. I wish him all the best,” she explained.
Ubogagu listed Coppell HS, Pali Blues, Stanford Cardinal and Houston Dash among her former clubs.
