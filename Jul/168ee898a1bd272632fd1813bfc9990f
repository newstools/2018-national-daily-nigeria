Drivers of two cars, a Sienna and a Camry, escaped death when a truck laden with 1 x 20 feet container fell on the two vehicles at Tin-Can Island, Apapa, Lagos, on Friday, July 27.




 According to an eyewitness, the truck’s brakes failed while descending from the bridge linking Tin-can Island to Apapa just before the round-about.

The eyewitness said in an attempt to avoid hitting the vehicles that were in front of him, the truck driver had climed the pavement, causing the truck to tilt to the side.

It was reported that on sighting the approaching truck the drivers of the cars got out of the vehicles before the tilting truck and its containers fell on them.

National Daily gathered that some security operatives from the Nigeria police, Nigerian Army and personnel of the Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA) were on ground at the scene to attend to the wounded.
