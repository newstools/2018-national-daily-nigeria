The former National Chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Chief John Odigie-Oyegun, at the weekend denied attacking the leadership style of APC National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole. The former national chairman refuted the report that he said the current APC national chairman is destroying the ruling party, stating that the chairman has his full support in all the efforts to reconcile aggrieved party members and restore unity as political parties prepare for the 2019 general elections.
National Daily gathered that Oyegun, in a statement by his Chief of Staff, Edwin Ikhinmwin, attributed the report to fake news that links him to a speech being circulated in the social media blaming Oshiomhole for destroying the party. Oyegun solicited the support and cooperation of all APC members and supporters for President Muhammadu Buhari and APC national chairman.
The statement read in part: “Chief John Odigie-Oyegun has not issued any press statement or spoken to the press on the concocted statement credited to him. We view this as part of the fake news being disseminated to magnify the ongoing challenges facing the Party and create new fissures between the former National Chairman and the incumbent chairman, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, to frustrate ongoing reconciliation efforts within our Party. The former APC National Chairman fully supports all efforts to reconcile and unify the party.
“Chief John Odigie-Oyegun uses this opportunity to call on all Party leaders, members and supporters to embrace the ongoing peace talks led by President Muhammadu Buhari and the Party’s National Chairman to restore stability within the Party, so that we can position our Party as a unified and strong political fighting force going into the forthcoming General Elections in 2019.”
Oyegun has been missing in action since he quit office as national chairman and in the post-convention period that APC began to lose quality members across the country.
