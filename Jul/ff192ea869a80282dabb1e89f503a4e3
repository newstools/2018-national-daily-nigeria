Deputy Senate President Ike Ekweremadu, on Tuesday raised alarm over his placement on House arrest by the Nigeria Police and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) that laid siege to his residence in Abuja, protesting that he never received invitation from any security agency.
Ekweremadu in a statement by his Special Adviser on Media, Uche Anichukwu, complained that he was assigned to preside over Senate plenary on Tuesday while Senate President Abubakar Bukola Saraki was to honour an invitation by the police.
The statement read: “The Apo Legislative Quarters residence of the Deputy President of the Senate, Senator Ike Ekweremadu, is currently under the siege of men of the Nigeria Police Force and the operatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC).
“With the President of the Senate, Dr. Bukola Saraki, expected to report to the Intelligence Response Team of the Nigeria Police Force in Guzappe, Abuja, this Tuesday morning, Senator Ekweremadu was expected to preside over plenary.
“They took over the entire vicinity before 6:00 a.m. There is no going in or coming out.
“There was no prior invitation to the senator by any of the security agencies or the EFCC.”
Accordingly, Ekweremmadu was under house arrest and did not attend Senate plenary on Tuesday where 15 decamped from the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), and one to the ADC.
National Daily gathered that Senate President Saraki had insisted that he along with other senators would visit Ekweremadu at his residence.
