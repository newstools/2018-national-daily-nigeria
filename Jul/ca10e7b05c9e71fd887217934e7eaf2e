Manchester United are considering alternatives to Harry Maguire as Leicester demand £65m for England’s World Cup star,National Daily gathered.
Jose Mourinho may switch his sights to Barcelona defender Yerry Mina, who scored twice for Colombia in Russia, including against Maguire in the last-16.
Everton have been strongly linked with the 23-year-old who has struggled to settle at the Nou Camp since joining in January.
He scored in a 3-0 win over Poland before a last-gasp equaliser in the penalty shootout defeat by England earlier this month.
United have made an approach for England defender Maguire but Leicester do not have to sell and have no desire to let Maguire follow Riyad Mahrez out of the club this summer.
Maguire remains confident that he will move to Old Trafford but time is against United to complete the deal before the transfer window closes ahead of their Premier League opener — against Leicester on August 10.
