Armed bandits on Sunday attacked a village in Birni-Gwari local government area of Kaduna state, abducting seven people including two nursing mothers,  an 8-day old baby and killing three others.

According to Ibrahim Nagwari, Chairman of the Birnin-Gwari Vanguards for Security and Good Governance, the incident occurred at  Unguwar Dan-Baki, Sabon-Layi village around 7pm.

He said one of the nursing mothers was abducted alongside her eight days old baby.

Nagwari said the gunmen had a field day as they carted away cattle used for traction by villagers.

Garba Tanko, a witness, was quoted to have said the attack took place during the “Maghreb” (evening) prayers.

“The attackers had a field day and carted away cattle use for animal traction by the villagers in their farms,” Nagwari said in a statement.

“The attackers are using a corridors of Kamuku Forest and Kuyambana Forest in Zamfara state to terrorized farming communities in Birnin-Gwari local government territories.

“As the military and police personnel are advancing to secure many parts of our territories from armed bandits and kidnappers especially along Birnin-Gwari-Kaduna road as well as Birnin-Gwari-Funtua road, we are calling on the federal government to deploy more security forces to Birnin-Gwari to prevent influx of armed bandits escaping military onslaught in Zamfara state to Birnin-Gwari.”

Mukhtar Aliyu, spokesman of the Kaduna state police command, could not be reached to react on the incident as his telephone was out of reach when this report was filed.
