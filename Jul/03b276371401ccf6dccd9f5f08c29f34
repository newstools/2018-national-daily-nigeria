The Commissioner of Police, Lagos State Police Command, Mr. Edgal Imohimi, at the third Stakeholders Meeting on Security Policing in the state, ordered that no police officer, henceforth, would be on duty in mufti. The CP, accordingly, directed that all police officers must wear uniform while on duty in Lagos State.
Imohimi cautioned that “any policeman who carries out operational duties in mufti will be sanctioned.”
The CP, however, pointed out that only policemen in investigation units will be allowed to wear jackets with the inscriptions of their units on them.
The third Stakeholders Security Meeting organised by the Area ‘D’ Command, Mushin, was focused on the theme: ‘Policing the Community by the Community.’
The CP had declared: “Henceforth, no policeman should carry out operational duties in Lagos in mufti without police uniform. The only units allowed to wear jackets with the inscription of his unit on it are the Anti Cultism unit, Anti Kidnapping unit, RAIDER; and the Federal Special Anti-Robbery Squad, FSARS.
“Every other policeman on operational duties must be in uniform. They will only be in mufti only if they are attached to the investigation unit of the command.
“We don’t want any policeman to cause us any embarrassment.”
The CP disclosed that the two policemen, who allegedly assaulted a lawyer last week at Ikoyi, Lagos, would be demoted in ranks, for wearing plain clothes to effect the arrest of the legal practitioner.
Imohimi appealed to Lagosians to support the State Command in the fight against unprofessional conduct by policemen by reporting any policeman in uniform found drinking beer in the public, on the designated numbers in the public domain.
The CP stated that Police officers who performed well would be given letters of commendation, disclosing that 30 policemen were already in the commendation list.
