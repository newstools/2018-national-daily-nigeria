The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), on Tuesday condemned the actions of the security operatives who laid siege to the residence of the Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki, and the Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu, in attempt to stop them from att3nding the Tuesday sitting of the National Assembly where 43 members of APC lawmakers dumped the ruling party.
PDP0 National Chairman, Prince Uche Secondus, in a statement on Tuesday in Abuja, called on stakeholders and elder statesmen in Nigeria to caution President Muhammadu Buhari, protesting his actions are detrimental to the survival of democracy in the country.
Secondus expressed that it was unfortunate that President Buhari allowed the siege on the leadership of the National Assembly by security agencies to happen under his watch.
The PDP National Chairman contended that it was bad that President Buhari, who was a beneficiary of democracy in 2015, has allegedly done nothing “but destroyed every fabric of democracy and the rule of law” in the country.
Secondus decried that the Federal Government was using the security agencies to overthrow the leadership of the National Assembly in “order to make it comatose.”
