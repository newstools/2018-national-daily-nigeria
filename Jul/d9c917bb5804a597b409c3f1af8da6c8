Whether at the World Cup for Brazil or in a five-a-side knockabout, Neymar cannot resist bringing out his array of tricks and skills.
The striker starred in a small-sided tournament on Saturday, the Neymar Jr Five, the world’s largest five-a-side competition with teams from all the over the world competing to reach the final stages.
After the tournament was completed, Neymar stuck around for a casual game with friends – but there was little relaxed about the striker as he scored a wonderful goal.
In a clip posted to Instagram, Neymar is seen picking up the ball under pressure from two yellow-bibbed players on the left, however he cuts past them with little bother.
The shirtless PSG striker gets directly in front of goal before flicking the ball with his heel past the helpless goalkeeper before running away to celebrate.
It shows the joy Neymar still has while playing football, even after a somewhat disappointing summer in which Brazil lost in the quarter-finals of the World Cup in Russia.
Earlier in the day Neymar and his son, Davi Lucca, had watched the five-a-side tournament take place in Santos, where the striker started his career.
