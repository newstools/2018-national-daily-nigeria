Sokoto Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal is about to announce his defection from the APC to the PDP.
Most members of the state assembly are also expected to tail him to his new party.
Tambuwal, according to party sources, is gunning for Aso Rock in 2019, and heâ€™s banking on the PDP governors who assure him they have his back.
Tambuwal, who hopped into the APC when he was speaker in 2013, will be the second APC governor to jump ship in recent tims. Benue Gov. Sam Ortom led the way early in the week. And Kwara Gov Ahmed Abdulfatah has said he may leave the APC, too.
The ruling APC has been bleeding since Tuesday when a wave of defection hit the National Assembly.
Fifteen senators, including those from Sokoto, announced their move to the PDP and ADC in the upper chamber while 36 hopped into the opposition in the lower chamber.
