Senator Shehu Sani (APC, Kaduna) has descrined as too late conciliatory efforts by the new APC National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole, to reconcile the aggrieved members of the ruling party.
“I wish Adams had come earlier,” the Kaduna senator told reporters on Tuesday.
“Like I said these grenades that were laid by the former chairman will explode in a matter of days.”
Sani explained that the ward, local government and state congresses in Kaduna were flawed, and that complaints he and other party members lodged were ignored by former chairman John Odigie-Oyegun and his National Working Committee
He noted party leaders including President Muhammadu Buhari have been unable to handle the crisis brewed by Kaduna Gov. Nasir el-Rufai.
“How can a governor openly called for violence against Senators and not a statement came from the seat of power cautioning such a governor?
“How can a governor move bulldozers and demolish a house of a fellow party member, the one who helped him to be where he is and there is not even a statement from the presidency?
“The governor uses the machinery of the state to emasculate political opponents. He even framed me for murder and there was no statement that came from the presidency to caution such a governor.
“Virtually Kaduna state under governor El-Rufai does not create conducive environment for any of us to remain in that party (APC),” the lawmaker said.
Sani noted there were three attempts to resolve the Kaduna APC crisis– the Inuwa Abdulkadir committee ; the Governor Masari- led committee; and Tinubu’s attempt to reconcile members of the party.
None of these, according to him, has worked out.ishehu sani
