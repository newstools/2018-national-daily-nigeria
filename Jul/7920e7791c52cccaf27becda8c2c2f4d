Deputy Senate President Ike Ekweremadu has finally wound up in the EFCC office.
He arrived at the commission’s office in Abuja between 9am and 10:00 a.m. on Tuesday
“We have some questions for him bordering on corruption. But we do not know yet when he would be released, we will know this by 5:00 p.m,” Premium Times quoted an EFCC source.
The commission and the deputy Senate president have been in a back and forth for a while, the last being the invasion of his Abuja home last Tuesday when he failed to appear as the EFCC summoned.
He has been accused of owning over 20 properties abroad, some purchased using shell firms and political fronts.
Ekweremadu has denied all allegations.
He claims he is being persecuted politically, urging anybody with evidence to come forward.
The EFCC has not released any official statement on the latest development.
