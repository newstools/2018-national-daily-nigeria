Brazil star, Neymar is widely touted to become the direct replacement for Ronaldo at Real Madrid, despite the club suggesting they’ve not made an official move.
However, in an interview with Omnisport, the Brazil international sidestepped the Los Blancos talk and gave his opinion on the 33-year-old joining the Serie A champions.
“Cristiano Ronaldo’s departure for Juventus will change Italian football,” Neymar said. “It will once again be the Italian football that I saw as a child.
“Cristiano is a great player, is a football legend, a genius, so we have to respect him. I’m happy for his decision, I think it was a difficult decision for him, and I wish him luck, but not against PSG.”
