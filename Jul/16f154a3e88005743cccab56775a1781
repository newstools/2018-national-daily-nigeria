The Presidency on Monday summoned the Inspector-General of Police, Ibrahim Idris, over the reported protest embarked by police personnel in Maiduguri, the Borno State capital, on Monday.
The police personnel were said to have protested over non-payment of their monthly salaries and allowances.
The IGP was seen heading towards the office of the Chief of Staff to the President, Abba Kyari, at the presidential villa, Abuja.
A source at the Presidential villa, who preferred to remain anonymous told NAN that the IGP was in the villa to brief the presidency on the police protest.
The Police in a statement issued by the Force Public Relations Officer, Jimoh Moshood, dismissed the media report, claiming that the policemen only made inquiries on their allowances and salaries before returning to their duty posts.
According to the statement, the delay in payment is due to late passage of the appropriation act, adding that with its assent by President Buhari, the issue will soon be addressed.
