Thierry Henry quit his punditry role at Sky Sports earlier this month as he wants to focus on his managerial career.

The former Barcelona striker was also part of Roberto Martinez’s coaching staff for Belgium’s World Cup campaign in Russia.

Henry, who also has coaching experience with Arsenal’s academy side, is now ready to land his first job as a manager.

National Daily reports that Henry has “verbally agreed” to take over from Steve Bruce at Villa

According to the newspaper, the Frenchman has been in talks with Villa’s new majority shareholders Nassef Sawiris and Wes Edens.

NSWE, the company co-owned by Sawiris and Edens, has injected a “significant investment” into Villa following the club’s financial difficulties under Dr Tony Xia.
