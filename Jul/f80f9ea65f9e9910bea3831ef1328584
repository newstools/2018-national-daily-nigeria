A woman has been arrested and charged with letting men rape her 2-year-old daughter who reportedly contracted sexually transmitted disease after the incident.
25-year-old Azzie Watson of Independence, Kansas City was on Tuesday charged with child abuse and endangerment.
WDAF-TV reports that court documents say Watson’s boyfriend recorded Watson talking about repeatedly taking her daughter to a house where her daughter was raped about five times. She says on the recording that she watched.
Police were given the recording last month while responding to a rape report at a hospital.
It was also claimed in the court documents that Watson told detectives what she said in the recording was a lie because she was scared of her boyfriend.
When Detectives told Azzie, her daughter also tested positive for a sexually transmitted disease, the mother said she didn’t know how that was possible.
Watson is currently at the Wyandotte County jail. Her bail is set at $75,000 and no attorney is listed for her in online court records.
