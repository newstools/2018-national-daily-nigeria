One player persistently linked with Chelsea this summer is Robert Lewandowski. The striker, though, has always fancied a move to Real Madrid, but Bayern Munich have always maintained that the Poland star is going nowhere.
The Bundesliga champions have once again re-iterated their stance. New coach Niko Kovac admits that Lewandowski “toys with going elsewhere” but that counts for little when the club are determined to keep him.
Borussia Dortmund have also been linked with a potential reunion with Lewandowski. Hans-Joachim Watzke said they would be willing to spend €100million to bring back the forward but it would appear the CEO’s stream is going squarely into the wind with that one.
