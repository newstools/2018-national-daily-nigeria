The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), on Monday, ridiculed the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on its plans for rebranding, change of name and the overtures to R-APC members for alliance to build broader and stronger coalition or a new mega political party.
The APC salvo came as PDP leaders were holding the National Executive Council (NEC) meeting at the National Secretariat, Abuja, on Monday to conclude plans for change of name and alliance with the R-APC members who had insisted on the change of name from PDP as condition to join the party in the preparations for 2019 general elections to wrest power from the ruling APC.
APC National Publicity Secretary, Bolaji Abdullahi, in a statement on Monday, mocked the opposition political party, describing the PDP move as looking for life after death.
The statement declared: “After three years in the wilderness, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) is understandably excited with possibility of hiding its irredeemably bad image under the heap of a new coalition.
“Like the vulture, PDP sees every altercation as a potential opportunity for a feast.
“If PDP is not alleging wild conspiracies, they are threatening to boycott elections or announcing fake defections. What is clear with all these is that no matter how long a leopard lives, it cannot change its spots.
“What President Muhammadu Buhari and Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, the National Chairman of our Party are doing, persuading every aggrieved member not to leave the Party, is what responsible and sensible party leaders would do.
“Party politics is a game of number. And that game is addition. If the PDP had the same presence of mind in 2015, perhaps the calamity that befell them would have been averted.
“We challenge the PDP to face Nigerians on their own merit in 2019 and stop shopping around for supporters.”
