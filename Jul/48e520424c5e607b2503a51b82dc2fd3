The Imo State House of Assembly has intensified efforts toward the impeachment of the Deputy Governor, Prince Eze Madumere, adopting alternative and indirect process to officially serve the Deputy Governor Impeachment notice through newspapers.
National Daily gathered that Madumere was on Tuesday served impeachment notice through Newspaper publications, which was signed by the Speaker, Right Honourable Acho Ihim, and 13 members of the House.
The impeachment notice: “Notice of gross misconduct,” was said to outline the alleged misconduct raised against the deputy governor. The Speaker had declared that the notice of impeachment is in accordance with pursuant of Section 188(2)(b) of the 1999 constitution.
The notice read in part: “Take notice that pursuant to Section 188(2)(b) of the 1999 constitution, I Right Honourable Acho Ihim, Speaker of the House of Assembly, Imo State of Nigeria, do hereby serve upon you Prince Eze Madumere, Deputy Governor, Imo State of Nigeria, the notice of misconduct, duly issued under the hand of not less than one-third of the members of the Imo State House of Assembly.”
The Lawmakers who signed the notice were identified to include: Ugonna Ozuruigbo (Nwangele); Chinedu Offor (Onuimo); Ikechukwu Amuka (Ideato South ); Lawrence Duruji (Ehime Mbano); Uche Ejiogu (Ihittte Uboma); Henry Ezediaro (Oguta); Maxwell Odunze(Orlu) and Lloyd Chukwuemeka (Owerri North).
Others were: Chika Madumere (Nkwerre); Uju Onwudiwe (Njaba); Nogozi Obiefule (Isu); Victor Onyewuchi (Owerri West) and Arthur Egwim (Ideato North).
Madumere incurred the wrath of Governor Rocha Okorocha for standing on his way to impose his son-in-law, Uche Nwosu, as his successor in 2019. Okorocha accused the deputy governor of aligning with opposition forces in Imo APC to ensure the governor’s woeful defeat in the APC congresses in the wards, local government and state levels in Imo State.
