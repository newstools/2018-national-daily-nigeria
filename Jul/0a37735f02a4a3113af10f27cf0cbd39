As we countdown to the crunch game between Nigeria and Argentina, concerns have been raised over the defensive ability of the Super Eagles,National Daily learnt.
This is warranted given the number of dead balls we have given away in dangerous positions not forgetting the spot kicks as well as the issues of defending corner kicks
In light of all this, Africa’s foremost vehicle manufacturing company, IVM has expressed its desire to solve that problem by sending 2 33-seater luxury buses (IVM 6800) to Russia to man the defence of the Super Eagles
The IVM 6800 is sturdy, reliable, doesn’t lose composure and inspires topnotch confidence with its incredibly strong features to make sure all Messis and Di Marias are kept at bay, enabling Musa and Co to focus on getting us the much needed goals
With IVM 6800 in our defence, Nigerians can rest easy that the match is firmly in our favor.
