Burkina Faso striker Aristide Bancé has accused Egypt and other North African countries of racism and attacked management of his club Al Masry.
Bancé is currently recovering from an Achilles tendon injury he sustained during Al Masry’s 2-0 victory over UD Songo in the CAF Confederation Cup group stages.
“CAF president wanted to know why African teams like Senegal, Tunisia, Egypt did not go far in this World Cup. I would like to tell him to give a look at African football a little bit. I think there is injustice,” Bancé said in a video posted on his Facebook page.
“A lot of our black brothers who are suffering in countries like Tunisia, Morocco and Egypt. I have a friend who just wrote to me earlier and we play in the same club, he is there in Egypt. They confiscated his passport and falsified a document to say that he received all his due payments and the Egyptian FA there support the club. The case is very serious. We Africans with dark skin, we are not respected.”

“Football is not slavery but over there, there is slavery in Egypt. It has to stop, I was a victim of that, I am talking about it and nothing will fear me. Foreign players normally have the right to a residence permit. But there [in Egypt] most foreigners do not have the residence card. They are given a visa for three to four months. When the visa expires, you have to leave the country. And when you do not leave every day there is a penalty.”
“There are a lot of players out there who have to pay those penalties but have no money. The clubs abandon them in the street.”
