Paul Scholes says Paul Pogba must raise his game at Manchester United, claiming the midfielder needs to “use his brain” to ensure he becomes one of the game’s top players.
Despite his success in Russia, however, Scholes has questioned the midfielder’s consistency at club level and believes that a settled starting XI at Old Trafford may be the key to helping the Frenchman achieve that.
“Paul needs to find a consistency, I think,” Scholes told beIN SPORTS. “You look at his game, he can be brilliant one week and not so good the next week.
“He seems to be a player which you get a performance out of every three to four games. If you’re going to win leagues, that’s not enough, it’s just not enough.
“He needs to become that commanding player he was at Juventus – he was part of a set structure at Juventus, he knew every week which position he was going to play, who he was going to play with, and I don’t think that has helped him at United.
“There’s no doubt the lad has real quality – he’s shown in the World Cup that he can play,” Scholes added.
“He’s such a strong lad, he’s such a fit lad. He can run, he has great technique as well, great ability. But he needs to use his brain a little bit more to become a top footballer.”
