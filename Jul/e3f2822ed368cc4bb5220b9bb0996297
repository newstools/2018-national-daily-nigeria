The Premier League summer transfer window 2018 has kicked-off with some intriguing deals so far.
Liverpool have done some fantastic business already this summer with the imminent signings of Naby Keita and former Monaco midfielder Fabinho, as noted by BBC Sport, as they hope to mount a serious title challenge next season.
Their rivals Manchester Utd are also looking to make a statement of intent this summer with their two latest acquisitions, Fred and Diogo Dablot.
As per the BBC, Jose Mourinho’s men have reached an agreement to sign Brazil midfielder Fred from Shakhtar Donetsk for a reported £47m.
An agreement has been confirmed on Man Utd’s official website too.
Meanwhile 19-year-old, Dalot, is one of Portugal’s brightest prospects and could be earmarked as a long-term replacement for Antonio Valencia.
Premier League club officials will have to be quicker this season because of the changes to the window this summer.
Because the window opened earlier, Premier League clubs will no longer be able to buy players after 5pm on Thursday, August 9 – meaning a shorter window compared to recent seasons.
We’ll keep updating this page throughout the summer as we get news of every confirmed Premier League transfer deal.
