Due to the current position of Yobe Desert Stars Football Club of Damaturu n the Nigeria Professional Football League standings, the management of the club has given the technical crew six matches ultimatum ahead of the resumption of the league.
Managing Director of the club Mallam Abdulrahaman Ago told National Daily that”we decided to give the technical crew the ultimatum for the team to remain in the Nigeria football elite league this season,because we cannot play one season in the Nigeria Professional Football League and go back to the second division”.
“The second division is not our status,playing in the NPFL has given us alot pride in this region,we need to maintain that status”.
“As far as my concern, we have some  experience and best legs in the league, couple with our young talented squad who are ready to play their heart out on the field” He concluded.
Yobe Deserts Stars will host Heartland FC of Owerri to Damaturu on the 18th of July for the machday 25 of the Nigeria Professional Football League.
