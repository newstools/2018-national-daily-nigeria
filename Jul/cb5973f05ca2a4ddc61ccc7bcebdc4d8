The shooting of a female corps member, Linda Igwetu, in Abuja on Wednesday allegedly by a policeman just a day to her passing out has generated outrage on various social media platforms, with many Nigerians calling for a full investigation into the incident.

The police officer was said to have shot the corps member dead while she was on her way home with friends, at about 3am on Wednesday.

The corps member had served in the Mabushi area of Abuja and was meant to conclude her National Youth Service Corp (NYSC) programme on Thursday.

Many Nigerians, reacting to the murder, called on the authority to curb the brutality of some of its officers.

According to some of the tweets, police impunity has gotten worse over time, blaming police authorities for severally failing to caution erring officers.

“We cannot afford to lay back and be expecting things to work when we are ignorant of what ought to be expected or demanded from the leadership. It is time to get involved and know genuinely where the power of every nation emanates from.”




Segun Awosanya, an activist and convener of the #EndSARS campaign, said the deceased had gone out with friends to celebrate her end of year service when the incident happened.
Writing via his Twitter handle, he said: “They left for home at about 3am and was shot at shortly after the check point immediately after Ceddi Plaza by a Police Officer identified as Benjamin Peters.

“The bullet hit Angela on her side, by the midriff and she began losing blood in the open roof vehicle.

“She was rushed to the Garki hospital but they wouldn’t treat her until they see a police report despite the fact that the police officers were present. While the deliberation was ongoing, Angela bled to death.”

Awosanya said the case has been reported to the federal secretariat police station, and that the police report on the incident is being awaited.
