Gombe Governor Hassan Dankwambo of the PDP has gone ahead to congratulate APC Governor-elect Kayode Fayemi, for his victory in the Ekiti governorship election.
Fayemi defeated the PDP candidate Olusola Eleka, who is the deputy governor of Ekiti..
“We gave all the necessary support to our party and the candidate, Professor Kolapo Olusola Eleka to win the #EkitiDecides2018, but sad we lost. In life, you win some and lose some, ” Dankwabo tweeted on Sunday.
“Congratulations to the winner, Dr. John Kayode Fayemi,” Mr Dankwambo tweeted on Sunday.
“I call on our supporters to be steadfast. We must not lose hope and be discouraged. The task ahead is too great for us to dwell on the current setback. This defeat should further strengthen our resolve to give Nigerians, a credible alternative in 2019,” the governor said on the social media site.
Dankabo is the first and only PDP leader to have sacongratulated the APC candidate on his victory in the Ekiti election.
Others believe the July 14 election wasn’t free and fair.

The PDP is still reviewing the results and will make a categorical statement after the review.
