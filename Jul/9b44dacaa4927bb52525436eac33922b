The United States Consular General to Nigeria, John Bray, on Friday, paid a courtesy visit to Governor Ayodele Fayose of Ekiti State at the Government House, Ado-Ekiti, over reports of Police invasion of the Government House and subsequent Police brutality of the governor on Wednesday.
Governor Fayose holding a meeting with John Bray and his team in his office, narrated his ordeal with the Police and the obstruction of the campaign rally of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ado-Ekiti where teargas canisters were fired into the Government House, which cause momentary loss of consciousness of the governor, who was alter revived at the Government House Clinic.
The acts of the Police have generated tension in Ekiti State within 72 hours to the Saturday governorship election. The Police intensified attacks, including arrest of PDP leaders and supporters to intimidate people and pave way for the victory of the unpopular All Pr0ogressivews Congress (APC) and its candidate, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, whose campaign rallies failed to pull sufficient crowd that would convince APC leaders of victory.
The brazen Police harassment has continued to make the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari more unpopular across the country. APC leaders have also been celebrating the Police brutality in Ekiti as basic means of wining the Saturday governorship election in the state.
John Bray, however, reserved his comments after the meeting with Fayose. The US Consular General is head of a delegation of the United States Observers to monitor the Saturday governorship election in Ekiti State.
