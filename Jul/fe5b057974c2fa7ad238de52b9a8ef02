One time embattled Senator Ali Ndume, on Wednesday, underrated the emergence of the splinter Reform All Progressives Congress (R APC), dismissing their action as of no consequence to the political fortune of the ruling party.
The Senator, who once incurred the wrath of the Upper Legislative Chamber in the National Assembly, was of the view the emergent R-APC and nPDP  leaving the APC would never spell doom for the ruling party, noting: “but only God and time would tell.’
Ndume admitted politics is all about interest, acknowledged that there was, however, nothing wrong if an aggrieved group voices out its displeasure. He stated that movement from one political party to another is normal in politics.
Ndume had declared: “What is happening is part of politics, especially now in our political days, all of us are Nigerians and we know what is happening.
“So, politics is about interest and if somebody feels that his or her interest will be more protected by voicing out his dissent, it is Ok.
“This party is a party of time, decided by Nigerian masses and it is only God that can decide the time of a political party: God and Nigerians know that APC government is the light at the end of the tunnel.”
