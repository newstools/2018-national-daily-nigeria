“It should be noted that the Ekiti State 2018 gubernatorial election is very important and it is a litmus test for the 2019 general elections and the whole world is watching us.
“We are calling on all stakeholders to ensure that all hands are on deck to sustain the democratic gains we have obtained in the past few years.
“Politicians and those contesting in this election are encouraged to respect the rights of the electorate by adhering to the rule of the game.
“They should inform and educate their supporters on the need to eschew violence and embrace peace in all their activities,” she said.

“’The unfortunate incidence of forcible dispersion of citizens embarking on a peaceful campaign at Ado-Ekiti on Wednesday, July 11, is not helpful to maintaining the peace in the state,” she said.
