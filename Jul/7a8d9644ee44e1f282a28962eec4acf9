Under the present leadership of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) Ambassador Chris Giwa,  the Chairman Ondo State Football Association Otunba Dele Ajayi has been selected to lead the country’s delegation to Mauritania for the men’s  AFCON U20  qualifier slated for this weekend.
National Daily learnt that the delegation departed  the Nnamdi Azikiwe Airport, Abuja  this morning by 9:45am ahead of  the match which  comes up on Saturday in Mauritania.
Otunba Dele Ajayi who is an executive board member of the NFF also used the opportunity to call on soccer loving Nigerians to pray for the team’s success in Mauritania saying it will go a long way on setting the tone for a rather easy passage into the next round of the qualifiers.
The qualifiers will determine the teams that will participate at next year’s Africa Under 20 Nations Cup and a total of eight teams will qualify for the final tournament including Niger Republic who qualified automatically as hosts.
