The National Chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole, on Tuesday was at the State House, Abuja, to brief  President Muhammadu Buhari on the loss of 16 senators and 37 members of the House of Representatives who defected from the ruling party to the opposition earlier in the day.
The APC national chairman was accompanied to the Presidential Villa by Festus Keyamo SAN, Director of Communication and Strategy, Buhari Presidential Campaign Organization.

Oshiomhole, in self-consolation, had said that he is happy that some members of the Senate and House of Representatives dump APC for opposition political parties.
National Daily monitoring telecast reports in Abuja from Lagos noticed that Oshiomhole, in media interaction at the State House after brief meeting with President Buhari, described the lawmakers that defected from the ruling party as “mercenaries” who were in APC just to win election.
The national chairman scolded the defectors as right wing politicians who believe in the philosophy of “share the money” and did not belong to the progressives group.
The APC national chairman expressed that ruling party is “not disturbed at all”, adding that he is not losing sleep over the defections.
He was of the view that it is good that those who never believed in the APC are leaving ahead the electioneering activities because that would enable the party concentrate on its campaigns.
Oshiomhole was of the belief that those who defected cannot affect the electoral fortunes of APC because President Buhari got more votes than them in their own constituencies in the last election. He maintained that even while they were in the APC, they constituted themselves as opposition to the governing party.
APC lost 16 senators 15 of who defected to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and one to the African Democratic Congress (ADC); and 37 members of the House of Representatives.
