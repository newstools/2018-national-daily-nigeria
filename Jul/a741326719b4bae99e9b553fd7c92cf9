inister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige has finally responded to the threat issued by the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) that he could be suspended by the party over his failure to inaugurate board members of federal agencies and parastatals under his ministry.
Reacting on Wednesday, Ngige said he is not afraid being suspended by the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), saying the APC chairman was talking out of ignorance.
He explained that the board of the Nigeria Social Insurance Trust Fund (NSITF) was yet to be inaugurated because of reports of alleged diversion of funds to the tune of N48 billion.
When asked if he would comply and if he was not afraid of suspension from the party, Ngige said, “How? In a party that we formed and brought them in? The man is talking out of ignorance. I’m not afraid of suspension.”
The minister said he had reconstituted three boards out of the four agencies and parastatals under his ministry, but has not been able to constitute the board of NSITF because of cases of financial malfeasance, which have put the agency under investigation by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC).
The parastatals and agencies are the Nigeria Social Insurance Trust Fund (NSITF), National Directorate of Employment (NDE), National Productivity Centre (NPC), and Michael Imoudu Institute for Labour Studies (MINILS).
