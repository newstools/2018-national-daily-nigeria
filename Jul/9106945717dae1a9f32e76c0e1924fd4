The umbrella body of electricity distribution companies, Association of Nigerian Electricity Distributors (ANED) has accused the federal government of misleading Nigerians over its claims that electricity has improved since President Muhammadu Buhari took over in 2015.

Sunday Oduntan, ANED’s Executive Director for Research and Advocacy disclosed recently in an interview monitored by National Daily.

Recall that the federal government had said power generation was at the peak of 7,000MW since President Muhammadu Buhari came into office in May 2015, but Oduntan insisted that the country was close to that figure as at January 2015.




He said power generation capacity as at January 2015 was already at 6, 421MW and not 4,000 as being claimed by the government.  The director also said it wasn’t true that an excess generation of 2,000MW was idle.
He said: “A review of NERC’s “Daily Energy Watch” for January 28, 2015 would indicate a generation availability of 6,421MW – divided into peak of 4,230MW and constrained energy of 2,191MW. In other words, it is misleading to state that available generation has grown from 4,000MW in 2015, as a measure of progress, given that a volume of generation slightly under 7,000MW already or previously existed, prior to the beginning of this administration.

According to him, there is no stranded 2000MW, stating that while there is an available capacity of 7,000MW, the best that can be generated, at this time, is 5,000MW.
“This is because there is insufficient gas to power the thermal plants due to gas line limitations – for instance, the non-completion of the Oben pipeline, and the absence of a commercial framework that would encourage gas exploration.”
“In simple terms, the often-advertised and pronounced Disco limitation to take on 2,000MW of additional generation is not consistent with the facts or reality. This, therefore, shows that very little has actually changed contrary to the minister’s constant pronouncements.

Oduntan who also accused the federal government of creating confusion in the operations of the power sector said the Discos were compelled to respond to the significantly distorted picture being painted by the Minister of Power, Works and Housing in press briefing last week.
