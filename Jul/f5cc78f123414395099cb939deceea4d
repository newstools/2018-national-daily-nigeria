Thierry Henry has confirmed that he is stepping down from his punditry position with Sky Sports to pursue his ambition of becoming a football manager,National Daily gathered.
The Frenchman has worked with the broadcaster for four seasons and had previously committed to the £4 million-a-year position even when it came at the expense of a coaching role at Arsenal. You’ll remember that Arsene Wenger felt his former captain couldn’t have his cake and eat it while on the books at London Colney.
The 40-year-old says he’s eager to pursue a career in the dugout.“I would like to thank everyone at Sky for making me feel so welcome and at ease throughout my time with them and I wish them all the best for the future. Great memories.”
In a series of tweets, Henry wrote: “Over the last four years I have had some extremely rewarding coaching experiences in football,  also these  experiences have only made me more determined to fulfil my long term ambition to become a football manager.
“It is with sadness that I have decided that I must leave Sky Sports to enable me to spend more time on the pitch and concentrate on my journey to achieving that goal and  lookout for a more senior position having cut his teeth at international level.
