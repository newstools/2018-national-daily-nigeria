Condemns attack on Fayose




Former President Goodluck Jonathan on Thursday cautioned the All Progressives Congress (APC) government against deploying security operatives to intimidate people in Ekiti State and subvert transparent election in the Saturday governorship poll.
The former President in a statement by his media aide, Ikechukwu Eze, admonished that nothing should be done to deprive Governor Ayodele Fayose of Ekiti State his immunity which is guaranteed by the constitution. He maintained that Fayose should be given protection as the number one citizen of the state.
Former President Jonathan remarked that security operatives were meant to give voters the confidence to come out on Election Day, not to intimidate them.
He cautioned the security agencies to avoid unconstitutional behaviours but be committed to protect the laws of the land and prevent any development that would obstruct the deepening of democracy in Nigeria.
Jonathan declared: “I am appealing to the security agencies deployed to Ekiti State for the governorship election to carry out their duties according to the laws of the land by securing the state in a manner that will enable a peaceful electoral process,” he said.
“If it is true that the State Governor Ayodele Fayose was assaulted as reported in the media, my appeal is that such should not be allowed to happen again, since the governor’s constitutional immunity guarantees that he should be given official protection to freely conduct the business of governing the state.”
