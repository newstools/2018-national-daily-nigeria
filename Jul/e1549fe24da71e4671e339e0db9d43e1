On the issue of the case in Court of Arbitration, the President revealed that FIFA denied ban threat supposedly made towards Nigeria previously and gave evidences that they never did.
“We are all Nigerians. We are a sovereign Nation. We have agreed to be together. I think our constitution should be one and whatever it says, we should abide by it. As regards the FIFA ban, I can assure you that I have never been stronger than I am now.

So we will wait till that happens and not anticipate what happens next”.
