Senate President Bukola Saraki has come under fire for his double standard as the 2019 election preparations heat up.
The deputy national publicity secretary of the APC, Yekini Nabena, in a statement on Sunday accused Saraki of playing the role of a double agent in APC.
He said the senate president is free to associate with whomsoever he chooses, but he must do so according to the rules of the game, and not try to destroy the party.
Nabena said Saraki has betrayed the trust of the party by sponsoring rebellion within the ruling APC, adding Saraki has learnt nothing from his alleged betrayal of APC in 2015, when he emerged senate president against the wishes of the party.
The call was coming after Saraki’s aides and close allies–Abubakar Baraje, his Chief of Staff, Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, and others–have left the APC for the PDP.
Abdullahi Adamu, senator representing Nasarawa West Senatorial District, and former governor of Nasarawa state also accused Mr Saraki of being behind R-APCm a bunch of renegades from the nPDPled by Buba Galadima.
The R-APC has signed a memorandum of understanding with other parties to create a coalition under the name the Coalition of United Political Parties (CUPP).
So Nabena urged Saraki to make up his mind.
“Saraki must declare now where he belongs, whether he is for APC or other political interests. He cannot serve God and mammon.” he said.
“He cannot play hide-and-seek. He cannot hide behind his fingers.”
