The 35-year-old, who is currently without a club after parting ways with Indonesian outfit Persib Bandung, last played for the Black Stars in 2014 at the World Cup in Brazil.
Essien was one of the three players, alongside Sulley Muntari and Kevin-Prince Boateng, accused of masterminding agitations for players appearance fees during the tournament.
“This is because I’ve retired from international duty. I even retired before we went to the World Cup in Brazil but I was called back by coach Kwesi Appiah to come and help.
“And then in Brazil they treated me like something so I’m not playing for the country again. It’s time for the new generation,” he added.
Essien made his Ghana debut in 2002 and boasts of 58 caps and nine goals.
