Cristiano Ronaldo has “already signed” for Juventus according to the club’s former CEO Luciano Moggi, who claimed he tried to bring the Real Madrid star to Italy when he was a teenager.
National Daily learnt that Serie A champions Juventus are reported to have made a bid of €100 million (£88m/$116m) for Ronaldo, who is Madrid’s all-time leading goalscorer after nine seasons at Santiago Bernabeu.
Moggi, who headed up Juve’s board from 1994 until 2006 when he was a central figure in the Italian football scandal that saw him given a life ban from football, was initially sceptical of the deal going through, but has since claimed the transfer was already at an advanced stage.
The 80-year-old told Italian TV network Tele7Gold : “In my opinion, he has already signed and passed the medical examination with Juventus in Munich.
“This is what I think after talking to important people.”
