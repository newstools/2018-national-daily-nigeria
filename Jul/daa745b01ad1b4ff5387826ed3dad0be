The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) is now in renewed confidence that former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, Waziri Adamawa, is capable of sending President Muhammadu Buhari of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) packing from the Presidential Villa, Abuja in 2019.
PDP State Chairman in Adamawa State, Tahir Shehu, announcing a mega ‘welcome back’ rally planned to receive Atiku back his home political platform by the Adamawa PDP in Yola on Thursday, stated that if given the PDP ticket, Atiku Abubakar will send President Buhari packing from Aso Rock in the 2019 general elections.
National Daily gathered that Shehu was of the view that Atiku remains the only candidate with the requisite resources to confront and defeat the APC presidential candidate in the 2019 general elections.
The State Chairman at an interactive forum at the State Secretariat, celebrated that Atiku’s return to PDP is a “big catch” and potent block to rebuild the party.
Shehu maintained that the return of Atiku, alone, into the PDP, whether he chooses to vie for the presidency or not, was enough to make the PDP reclaim Adamawa State.
“Since the former Vice-President, Atiku Abubakar, the Waziri Adamawa, came to rejoin the PDP, Adamawa PDP has made a big catch. But there was never a time we organised any gathering that would ‘ginger’ the region and show the world that, yes, the former Vice-President is from Adamawa. That is why the Adamawa PDP chapter sat, negotiated and discussed and made consultations with all the stakeholders, from the grassroots to the top on the need for a mega rally, preparatory to Atiku’s declaration in Abuja,” , Tahir Shehu declared.
The former vice president is expected to formally declare for the presidential race on July 27, 2018, the day Adamawa PDP has scheduled to hold the mega rally to welcome him back to the PDP which he was a founding member.
