Liverpool are hopeful of completing a deal for Stoke City winger Xherdan Shaqiri this month, according to Goal.

Jurgen Klopp has identified the Switzerland international as one who can bolster his attacking options, while the presence of a release clause in the 26-year-old’s contract makes a deal a financially attractive one.

Goal understands Shaqiri will be available for around £13 million ($17m) following the Potters’ relegation from the Premier League, and that the former Bayern Munich man is keen on a move to Anfield.
