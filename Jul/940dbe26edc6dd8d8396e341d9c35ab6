President Muhammadu Buhari has expressed his respect for the values of democracy, freedom of choice as well as willingness to work with all members of the National Assembly, irrespective of their political party.
Reacting to the mass defection of the APC federal lawmakers  on Tuesday morning, the president noted that none of the defecting federal lawmakers of the All Progressives Congress (APC) had any specific grievances against him or the government he leads; ”neither did he harbour anything against any of them”.
He also said their decision will not affect the APC’s electoral chances.
“As the saying goes, all politics is local. We understand that some of the distinguished and honourable lawmakers have issues with their home states, especially on zoning which bars some of them from seeking another term in their constituencies,” he said.
Noting that the APC had done its utmost to stop the defections, the President commended the leadership of the party for relentlessly working for its unity and ensuring success in the upcoming elections.
President Buhari assured members of the APC of his total support and urged party faithful ”not to despair but to see the defections as a seasonal occurrence that happens on election eve”.
He expressed confidence that no harm or injury will be done to the party and its aspirations by the movements.
President Buhari wished all the decamped members the best in their future undertakings.
