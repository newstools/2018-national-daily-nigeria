Former Technical Director of the Nigeria Football Federation and  two-time chief coach of the Super Eagles , Adegboye Onigbingbe, has declared with the prevalent crisis rocking the country’s football with the emergence of Ambassador Chris Giwa as the factional president of the Nigeria Football Federation, which may attract a FIFA ban, notwithstanding, the country’s football need an urgent overhaul and rebirth to take it to the height which it deserves.
Adegboye explained that the problems in the NFF resurfaced on July 2, 2018 when Chris Giwa was ordered to take over the running of the football house in respect to a ruling by the Supreme Court.
Onigbingbe added that this verdict has been frowned at with some quarters stating that Fifa would ban Nigeria from international football for government interference.
The former General Manager of Shooting Stars Sports Club, Ibadan, told National Daily that I am not condemning anybody ,but I sincerely believe that Nigerian football needs a thorough overhaul. If it were possible for me, I would write to Fifa to excuse us for two years to re-organise our football.
“No football team in the country has an effective developmental programme, not even the NFF.Whether it is Giwa or Pinnick, we need to go back to the drawing board,” Onigbinde said
