Mr Secondus assured all presidential aspirants level playing field and tasked APC on ensuring level playing field for all parties in 2019 general elections.
Without mentioning names, Mr Secondus announced the defection of some commissioners, House of Assembly members and council chairmen from APC to PDP.
