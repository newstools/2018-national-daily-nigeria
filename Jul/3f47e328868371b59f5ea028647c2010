Massive pipeline explosion has broken out at Ilara area near Ogijo in Ogun State following the activities of suspected pipeline vandals.
According to a source, the fire started at about 10pm on 1 July 2018 and still burning as at Monday morning.
At the moment, it was learnt that no form of intervention has started with a view to bringing the fire under control.
In recent times, troops of the 81 Division serving at 174 Battalion, Odoginyon barracks have arrested and paraded some vandals who had been attacking most of those critical infrastructures and scooping fuel.
With the explosion, it is likely going to affect petroleum supplies since Mosimi depot would be shot down to contain the fire before repairs will be carried out by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC).
However, as a result of the explosion, residents of the community were said to have fled their homes to safety.
