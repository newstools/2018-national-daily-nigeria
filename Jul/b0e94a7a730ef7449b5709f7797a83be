Juventus and Real Madrid on Tuesday, July 10, agreed terms that will see Portugal’s all-time highest goalscorer, Cristiano Ronaldo move to Turin in a deal worth a reported £105 million.
After scoring a record 450 goals in 438 games, Cristiano Ronaldo, finally ended his 9-year stay with Real Madrid after agreeing to join Italian champions, Juventus.
Real Madrid made clear in their announcement that the transfer was driven primarily by the player’s desires.
The official 192-word statement from Real Madrid read:
“Real Madrid C. F. communicates that, according to the will and request expressed by the player Cristiano Ronaldo, we have agreed to transfer him to Juventus F. C.
“Today Real Madrid wants to express its gratitude to a player who has proved to be the best in the world and who has marked one of the most brilliant times in the history of our club and world football.
“Beyond the conquered titles, the trophies and the triumphs achieved in the playing fields during these nine years, Cristiano Ronaldo has been an example of dedication, work, responsibility, talent and improvement.
“He has also become the top scorer in the history of Real Madrid with 451 goals in 438 games. In total, [Ronaldo won] 16 titles, including 4 European Cups, three of them consecutively and four in the last five seasons.
“On an individual basis, in the Real Madrid jersey he has won four Ballon d’Ors, two (Fifa’s) The Best, and three Golden Boots, among many other awards.
“For Real Madrid, Cristiano Ronaldo will always be one of the great symbols and a unique inspiration for the next generations.
