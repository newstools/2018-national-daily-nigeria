The Lagos State Police Command had a festival of arrest of cultists early in the week, rounding up about 137 suspected cult members in the suburb of the state at various locations of initiations and annual ritual rites or anniversary.
National Daily learnt that the cultists were arrested during their seven/seven procession under the guise that they were having a birthday party, at different locations in Ikorodu and Ogombo areas in the suburbs of Lagos.
Lagos State Commissioner of Police, Imohimi Edgal, parading the suspects at the Command Headquarters, Ikeja, remarked that the State Command cautioned the cultists last Thursday to shelve the plan to hold their sacred day procession, known as the seventh day of the seventh month, in any part of the state.
He added that the Command further appealed to members of the public   to provide the Police with information on any group of persons noticed to be gathering anywhere within their vicinity for unusual activities. The Police, he said, acted on useful intelligence provided to the Command, then, transmitted to the Officer In-Charge of the Anti-Cultism, resulting in the arrest of 120 suspects at Ikorodu where they were observing the 7/7 day. Additional 17 suspected cult members were said to be arrested at Ogombo, Ajah, during initiation rites and 7/7 anniversary.
Imohimi stated he has ordered that the cultists should be profiled, thereafter; Police would invite their parents and guardians for questioning.
The Commissioner narrated that items recovered from the suspects include one big banner with zero, seven and black axe logo, a yellow keg containing three litres of liquid substance and six other small kegs with similar contents suspected to be mixture of different dangerous drugs, adding that other exhibits include one big clay pot, one small calabash and one locally-made cut to size pistol.
