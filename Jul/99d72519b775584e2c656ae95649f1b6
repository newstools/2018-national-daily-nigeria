The emergence of Reformed All Progressives Congress (R APC) has thrown the mainstream APC into unexpected shock over the looming threats implosion of the ruling party.
Party leaders have had sleepless night since Wednesday when the declaration was made in Abuja. While President Muhammadu Buhari engaged three APC governors in an emergency meeting in Abuja on Thursday, APC National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole, had on Wednesday, held consultations with the President of the Senate and the APC caucus in the Senate of the National Assembly, appealing for restraint.
Oshiomhole appealed to the President of the Senate, Dr. Abubakar Bukola Saraki, and APC Senate caucus in the National Assembly for patience, promising his leadership commitment to amicably resolving the conflicts and restoring justice and equity in the interests of all members of the party.
 The APC chairman further begged Alhaji Buba Galadima, National Chairman of the R APC and his group to be patient, reassuring of his commitment to lasting solutions to the ravaging conflicts in the ruling party.
Oshiomhole had said inter alia, “… I ask you Mr. President of the Senate and Distinguished Senators to trust that working together along with our leaders who are not here, we are committed to finding solutions that everyone will be able to smile, remain in the house, work in the house.”
The next weeks will be preoccupied with intense consultations, meeting, bargaining towards consensus building in APC.
