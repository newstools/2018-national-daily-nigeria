The Ooni of Ife, Ooni Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi, Ojaja II, has cautioned against the trend of political violence that herald the Saturday, July 14 governorship election in Ekiti State, part of which were instigated and perpetuated by the Police.
The Ooni hosting the British High-Commissioner to Nigeria, Paul Arkwright, who was on a courtesy visit to his Palace in Ile-Ife, Osun State, declared he is unhappy over the violent upsurge few hours to the governorship election in Ekiti State.
The Police had on Wednesday betrayed public trust and compromised their neutrality as the Nigeria Police not to take side with any political party in performance their duty, when they launched attack on leaders and supporters of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) at a campaign rally in Ado-Ekiti, including assault on Governor Ayodele Fayose, who suffered neck strain and momentary loss of consciousness after inhaling teargas from the Police attack. The Police had fired gunshots into the air to disperse PDP supporters and scuttle the party’s campaign at Fajuyi Park in Ado Ekiti. However, the Deputy Inspector General of Police coordinating the team in the state had admitted the mistake and promised it won’t be repeated.
The Ooni, however, admonished: “What I heard happening in Ekiti State during this electioneering period does not make me happy as their father. Enough of crisis, we do not want any crisis in Yorubaland.”
“Where there is violence, progress and tranquility will be deprived, but where there is peace, there is progress.
“I specifically warn all youths in Ekiti State to maintain peaceful coexistence before, during and after the election, as brighter future awaits them if they productively discover themselves,” the monarch stated.
