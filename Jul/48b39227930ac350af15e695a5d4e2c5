R-APC Chairman Buba Galadima has revealed how he midwifed the relationship between President Muhammadu Bhari and APC leader Bola Tinubu before the 2015 election.
In the current edition of The Interview magazine, Galadima said he was responsible for the alliance between the CPC and ACN, an alliance Buhari, he said, initially objected to.
Buhari and Tinubu were the respective leaders the party before their 2014 merger.
“Buhari was the one against the alliance with Tinubu and I don’t want to say anything,” said Galadima.
“Let Buhari deny what I have said. I was for it and I organised it and wrote a memo that even produced a candidate for the vice presidency, this same Osinbajo.”
According to him, Buhari mught have picked somebody other than VP Yemi Osinbajo in the INEC form that was to have been submitted.
Galadima said he is planning to write an open letter to Buhari very soon, adding that the president was a “floored candidate” who will lose his deposit if he contests re-election.
“If he was raising cattle in Daura, I wouldn’t bother about him. I’m criticising him because he’s the President of Nigeria and he’s not doing very well,” Galadima said.
He equally dug into the APC Chairman Adams Oshiomhole, describing him as a latter-day Buharist bent on hijacking the ship.
