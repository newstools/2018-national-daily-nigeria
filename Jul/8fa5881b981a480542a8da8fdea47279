The Abuja-Kaduna highway was scene of horror when kidnappers launched deadly attack on travelers on the route on Sunday.
National Daily gathered that about four persons were killed and several others kidnapped by gunmen who invaded the Kaduna-Abuja highway in search of victims.
It was gathered that Kaduna State Commissioner of Police, Austin Iwar, confirmed the attack, assuring that the Police are tracking the bandits.
Eye witness account was said to have disclosed that the attack occurred around 6:00 pm near Gidan Busa village, located between Jere and Kateri communities.
The Abuja-Kaduna highway which is about one and a half hours drives between the two cities, record high traffic on daily basis. Most people work in Abuja but reside in Kaduna, plying the road on daily basis to work between Monday and Friday. Some others return to Kaduna or visit Abuja on weekends. Others road users include wide range of travellers out of Abuja to other states in the North or those moving southward from the upper North.
Apparently, opportunities of getting victims for kidnapping are high. The bandits were said to have stopped vehicles and started shooting sporadically and unfortunately, about four persons lost their lives and some others taken away by the kidnappers.
National Daily gathered that the Sunday kidnap operations occurred after one week security operatives carried out search for arms in Kuriga community.
