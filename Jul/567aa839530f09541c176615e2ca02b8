As Nigeria’s representatives in the English Super Cup going on in Manchester chase two trophies in two final games on Sunday, Abass Akande Obesere has challenged the players to not rest on their oars.
The encouragement from Obesere, the chairman of the academy, came following the squad’s qualification for the two final both in the youth and men’s category of the competition.
The Buruj Boys have been in splendid form since they arrived in the Queensland on Thursday winning most of their games to put themselves in a vantage position to win the two titles.
Both Omo Rapala crooner and his UK-based promoter Bobby Balogun of Bobby Promotions International have expressed their readiness to receive the team and celebrate the title win with them.
Obesere and Balogun have been the pillars of support since the team landed in Manchester and they have both promised to do more.
In some of the results of Saturday, Buruj Sports Academy defeated Balloan FC of Scotland by 3-2 while they also recorded a 4-0 win over Casa Vale Kurdish United.
They also played a hostess draw against Tony Celtic FC while their only loss is against Sale Amateurs which ended in 0-1.
