Thrty-two-year-old Kevin Anderson usurped crowd favourite Roger Federer in the quarter-final of Wimbledon on Court 1 as he played a marathon 5-setter that last 4 hours and 15 minutes,National Daily learnt.
The match didn’t look like it would last more than a couple of hours when the 8-time champ raced to a 2-set lead. However, a splendid fightback from the No.8 seed saw the match go into the decider.
The set extended well past an hour mark with both players refusing to give an inch to the other. In an astonishing sequence, Anderson won 3 games in a row on his serve without conceding a point.
National Daily gathered that  Federer slipped in the 23rd game of the set. He hit two unforced errors, first hitting long with the back hand and then missing a short ball on his forehand.
He then served his first double fault of the match to hand his opponent a break point. Anderson cashed in on the opportunity and took the game. He held his serve with aplomb in the subsequent game and earned his first ever win over the Swiss maestro.
Anderson will face the winner of Rafa Nadal and Juan Martin Del Potro.
