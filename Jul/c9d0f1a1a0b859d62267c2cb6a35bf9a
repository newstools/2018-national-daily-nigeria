One of the new faces at Barcelona for the 18/19 campaign, Arthur has spoken of how his compatriot, Neymar, pushed him to sign for the club that the now Paris Saint-Germain player left a year ago. Despite his youth, Arthur isn’t afraid to play at the Camp Nou and doesn’t mind being compared with Andres Iniesta or Xavi. For now, however, he just wants to concentrate on enjoying his football and, hopefully, winning titles.
“I spoke with Neymar and he said wonderful things about the city,” Arthur said to Mundo Deportivo and Sport. “That the way of life is spectacular… it was really only good words, and he thought that I would like to be here. “One of Arthur’s only regrets is that he didn’t manage to have Iniesta as a teammate, the latter having just arrived in Japan to start his new adventure at Vissel Kobe. “He is my idol,” the Brazilian continued. “I learned many things watching him play, but he has chosen another path.” Arthur has spent his first few days living the dream of belonging to Barcelona but has still yet to meet some of the players, including Lionel Messi.He also had words of praise for his new coach, Ernesto Valverde, and noted the positive aspects to his move.” Mister Valverde is a very intelligent coach,” he added. “He is attentive to the smallest detail and is always willing to correct us. “Everything is going better than I imagined. “I want to fulfill the dream of playing in a full Camp Nou and scoring a goal, but the important thing is not the start, but the end; winning every possible title.”
