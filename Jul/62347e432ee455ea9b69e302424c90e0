Nigerians including sports journalists, musical stars who boarded Qatar Airways from Moscow to Doha  yesterday have been made to face inhuman treatments as they have been abandoned by the authorities,National Daily learnt.
The officials who are supossed to provide accommodation for the passengers upon arrival at 6pm before leaving by 2am to Lagos on Tuesday have been left uncared for.
Captain Abu Abaidal, a Sudanese who is a top security officer with the airline outfits said there is nothing they can do to help the situation.
“We can not help because all the hotels have been booked”. “I spoke to the Immigration and they say no way to granting visas”.
Meanwhile, some passengers who hail from other countries were given preferential treatment over the Nigerians as they were given better hotels to rest.
A Nigerian by name Andrew Eshibogwu believes the treatment meted out on Nigerians is an act of discrimination by the airline company.
“This is so sad to experience. How can Nigerians be treated like this”. “We traveled 6hours from Moscow and now they want us to stay without been cared for before leaving again in the wee hours of the morning”. “Other passengers from other countries were given accommodation but why Nigerians”, he lamented.
Reports say the company has it as a rule to give accommodation and treat their customers well whenever they are on transit in Doha.
As at the time of filing this report, a total of 31 Nigerians including a Kenya lady are still left stranded with no solution in the offing.
Nigerians pay between N350,  000 to N584, 000 for tickets which include the return ticket.
