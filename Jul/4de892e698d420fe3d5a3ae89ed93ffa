‘Liverpool has confirmed Mohamed Salah has signed a new long-term contract with the club,’ read part of a statement on the club’s official website.
The African Footballer of the Year registered the second highest total of strikes in a season in the Reds’ history last term, just three goals behind Ian Rush’s record of 47 and surpassing Roger Hunt’s haul of 42.
The 26-year-old, who was named as both the PFA Players’ Player of the Year and the Football Writers’ Association’s Footballer of the Year, also shone in his country’s qualification for the 2018 World Cup.
