Is’haq Modibo Kawu, director general, National Broadcasting Commission (NBC), said that the commission would wield the big hammer on broadcast stations across the nation for their indebtedness to the tune of N4.2billion.
Kawu,, who spoke at the NBC Summit 2018 with the theme “Broadcast Content Development: Deepening Democratic Culture in Nigeria,” organized for broadcast stations which was held in Enugu, said so many broadcast stations are currently indebted to the commission even when the commission was supposed to be generating revenue for the federal government.
Bilbis said: “Very soon NBC will begin to sanction broadcast station indebted to the commission. We are supposed to be gerating funds for the federal government, and N4.2billion is a whole lot of money. When we sanction, it’s because we need to sanction.”
He further explained that the broadcast stations indebted to the commission comprised both television and radio stations, adding that part of their indebtedness was in the failures to renew their licences with the commission over the years.
The event which was well-attended by notable broadcast media practitioners in the country was declared open by Chief Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, Enugu state Governor.
