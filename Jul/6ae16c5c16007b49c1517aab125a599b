Many families were not enable to raise such money that does not even constitute part of the funeral expenses
Chief Felix Okafor and Emeka Akukwe, identified to be speaking for of the community, narrated that the leadership of the town, three years ago, introduced what was known as burial levy of N1 million on every bereaved family in the area before they could commence the funeral arrangements of their loved ones.
“As a result of this, many families have abandoned their loved ones in morgues for months because they are finding the costs too high.
“So, they have to leave them in the mortuary until they can work out how to pay the levy. If you fail to do so, the town union leadership would mobilize thugs to attack you. This is the type of yoke we are passing through in Eziowelle community,’’ he narrated.
 “It is because of some of these anomalies that I am presented myself as a candidate in the just concluded town union election in the area,” Akukwe had declared/
He appealed for the urgent intervention Governor Willie Obiano, to save the people from the bondage and potential crisis.
