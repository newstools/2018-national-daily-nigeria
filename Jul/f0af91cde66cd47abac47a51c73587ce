Governors of the 36 states have called for a drastic action targeted at ending the rising cases of killings in the country and asked security agencies to take more drastic action to halt the bloodshed.
They made the call on Thursday when the National Economic Council met in the State House, Abuja.
Governor Willie Obiano of Anambra State told reporters after the meeting, presided over by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, that there is a growing concern, in the council and elsewhere, over the killings.
“I believe that all the appropriate agencies are aware that the concern is growing and I am confident that they will listen to the pleas of people and do something more drastic than has been done so far,” Governor Obiano said.
Still on security, the Anambra governor said the $1bn deducted from the Excess Crude Account for security purposes has yet to be expended.
The NEC has, however, taken a decision to set up a federal project monitoring unit to identify crucial areas for intervention, especially to mitigate flood and erosion situations.
Bauchi State Governor, Mohammed Abubakar, who also addressed reporters after the meeting, said the Federal Government has directed the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, to fast-track the decongestion of prisons and set up a stakeholders committee to that effect.
To help decongest the prisons, the council set free 1,310 inmates with minor offences with an option of fine.
