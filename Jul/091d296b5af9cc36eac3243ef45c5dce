Former President Olusegun Obasanjo has finally returned to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) after months of building the Coalition for Nigeria Movement (CNM) and thereafter strengthening the African Democratic Congress (ADC).
Obsanjoâ€™s return to PDP was consummated at the new alliance the PDP formed with 30 other political parties, including the ADC and the Social Democratic Party and the reformed All Progressives Congress (R-APC).
The new mega party alliance was concluded in Abuja on Monday.
