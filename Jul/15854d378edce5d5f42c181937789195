The All Progressives Congress (APC) has described the alleged exit of the governor of Benue State, Samuel Ortom, from the party as a rumour.
Reacting to what the party called speculation, on Monday in Abuja, Adams Oshiomhole, its national chairman, said the party had a cordial relationship with Mr Ortom.
He spoke to journalists after a closed door meeting with members of the party’s National Working Committee (NWC).
“I know that Governor Ortom is a very senior member of the party and he has said so repeatedly in print and has said to me one on one that he will not leave the APC unless he was pushed out.
“Since I assumed the chairmanship of this party along with my colleagues in the NWC, I know of a fact, that we have not shut out any governor and certainly not Governor Ortom.
“And in these days of social media, I will not be responding on the basis of rumour and unverified reports,” the APC chairman said.
