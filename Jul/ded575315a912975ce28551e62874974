Belgium skipper, Eden Hazard, has tipped France’s Kylian Mbappe to win the Ballon d’Or.
Speaking to beIN Sports France ahead of Tuesday’s World Cup semi-final clash between the two in Saint Petersburg, Hazard praised Mbappe’s abilities.
“Based on what he is showing, obviously there is Ballon d’Or capacity,” Hazard said.
“In terms of potential, as well as quality, for me, yes, he already deserves the Ballon d’Or.”
Hazard also said that he is now watching videos of Mbappe, which is now a reversal of roles.
“We have spoken a few times over the phone,” he said.
“Kylian told me that he watched my videos when he was younger. I am not sure if I pass for an old guy, but… I am not too old.
“Now, it is me watching his videos from time to time, and I have a lot of respect for him and what he is doing. We have never seen this [quick development] in modern football.”
