As Emir elevates him to Waziri Garin Ilorin




The Emir of Ilorin and Chairman, Kwara State Traditional Council, Professor Ibrahim Sulu–Gambari, at the end of a special prayer organised by the Royal Father on the recent victory of the President of the Senate, Dr. Abubakar Bukola Saraki, at the Supreme Court over allegations of false asset declaration, elevated Saraki to the position of Waziri Garin Ilorin, the Traditional Prime Minister of the Emirate.
National Daily gathered that the elevation of Saraki who has been the Turakin Ilorin, made him the Fourth Waziri Garin Ilorin, which was held by his father, Dr. Abubakar Olusola Saraki, till he died in 2012.
The Emir remarked that the elevation of the President of the Senate to Waziri Garin Ilorin, Kwara State, was in recognition of Saraki’s passion for the development of not only the emirate but the whole of Kwara as well as his political exploits that have brought fame to the state, particularly Ilorin Emirate.
“We are excited by your political exploits because of late you have become the beautiful bride whom politicians across the board are beckoning to be in their camps. This is a show of recognition of your worth and achievements as a politician,” Sulu-Gambari declared.
