Accuses INEC of releasing election materials to PDP





















The All Progressives Congress candidate and winner of the July 14, 2018, governorship election in Ekiti State, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, has been caught in phobia as the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) prepares documents to proceed to the Ekiti Governorship Election Tribunal. Probably suspecting that the authentic figures may be revealed, Fayemi was gathered to have accused the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) of allowing the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) lawyers access to electoral documents.   He protested that this was contrary to due practice.
National Daily gathered that Fayemi’s counsels complained of INEC  releasing electoral materials to PDP counsels without first notifying the other parties to the suit.
The lawyer of the governor-elect had argued that the action could provide opportunities for falsification of figures.
The former Minister of Solid Mineral Development was declared winner of the Ekiti State Governorship election by the INEC amidst controversies which included  the actions of the Police in intimidating PDP supporters and in some instances attacked Governor Ayodele Fayose. The Police, however, narrated their side of the story and pleaded to make amends in areas where errors were made.
Many stakeholders were thrown into consternation when INEC declared Fayemi winner of the election after the violence of the Police. They did not believe that the declaration reflected the real will or choice of the Ekiti People. Thus, National Daily gathered, that two prominent Senior Advocates of Nigeria (SAN), both of who h had won about three governorship cases over the years, volunteered to handle the case of the PDP at the Election Tribunal and beyond where necessary.
The involvement of the two SANs on the side of PDP constitutes serious threat to Fayemi and the APC in Ekiti.
