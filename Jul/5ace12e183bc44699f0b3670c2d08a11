A senior figure at Bayern Munich has confirmed that the club could sell Manchester United-linked Arturo Vidal this summer.

Bayern CEO Karl-Heinz Rummenigge has revealed in a press conference that the Chilean could leave the German champions, as the club have too many players in his position.

Rummenigge said: “We have stated several times that we have one, two extra midfielders in the team.

“We would rather do something that way, so that the coach does not suffer political stress. If there will be departures, but we will certainly work on it.”

Manchester United have been linked with a bid for the 31-year-old, while Inter Milan are reportedly ready to offer the former Juventus star a return to Serie A.

United manager Jose Mourinho recently cast doubt over the number of impending arrivals at Old Trafford, claiming that the club may only sign one more player.

“I would like to have two more players,” he said after his side’s International Champions Cup defeat to Liverpool. “I think I am not going to have two. I think it’s possible I am going to have one. It’s possible.”
