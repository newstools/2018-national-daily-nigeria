The CitizenGO has undertaken a 39-hour round trip from Abuja to Dapchi, Borno, to deliver Nigerians’ signatures to Mrs Rebecca Sharibu whose daughter Leah, a Christian, remains in hostage after Boko Haram released over 100 girls it kidnapped in March.
The NGO later went to Aso Rock to deliver the signed letter urging President Muhammadu Buhari to speed up effort in rescuing Leah who the terrorists refuse to release because she will not deny her faith.
“Most of the people, including Nigerians would dread taking a trip to North Eastern Nigeria,” Ann Koko, CitizenGO team leader, said.
“But CitizenGO is committed to making sure that persecuted Christians across the world receive as much support as possible.”
According to her, Leah’s mother expressed her hopes when she went through names of those that signed the petition.
“It is 4 months ,6 days without seeing my daughter,” said the sad mother.
She asked for Nigerians’ prayers as she pleaded with the federal government to show some more commitment in rescuing her daughter from the Islamic insurgents-Boko Haram.
In the letter it delivered to the presidency, the group also urged the government to end Christian persecution in Nigeria which, it believes, has really escalated.
