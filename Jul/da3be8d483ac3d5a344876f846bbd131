The Katsina Police Command will be investigating an allegation of sodomy made against one of its police inspectors named Lawal Mohammed.
The Inspector allegedly had sexual intercourse with a 13-year-old boy who cut off Mohammed’s manhood with a knife during the act Tuesday night at Tudun Markabu community in the Faskari Local Government Area of the state.
It was further learnt that the inspector might have been set up following allegations in the community that he was fond of having sex with young boys.
The officer was admitted to Faskari General Hospital from where police authorities reportedly removed him to another hospital in Katsina for protection.
Command’s Spokesman Gambo Isah confirmed the incident on Wednesday night, adding no arrest was made yet.
“We received a complaint from members of the community that a police inspector was involved in an immoral act and was injured in the process. We had to move him to a hospital for further treatment after he was found in a pool of his blood,” he said.
“All we are after now is saving his life. After that, the command will investigate him on the allegation that he was having sex with a 13-year-old boy when part of his penis was cut off by the boy. The outcome of the investigation will determine the next line of action by the command.”
