The Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, in a media interaction after the meeting of the Federal Executive Council (FEC) at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, on Wednesday, assured of amicable resolution of the feud  between the All Progressives Congress (APC) National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole, and Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr. Chris Ngige. The minister did not give details on how the impasse between the minister and the national chairman would be resolved.
It will be recalled that Oshiohmole, on Monday, threatened to expel Ngige, or any minister who failed to inaugurate members of board of parastatals under their supervision from the party.
Ngige had, in a statement by the Director of Press, Ministry of Labour and Employment, Samuel Olowookere, argued those  saying he had not inaugurated the Board of the Nigeria Social Insurance Trust Fund (NSITF) because he was awarding contracts were ignorant of the Procurement Act. The minister emphasized that boards of three of the four parastatals under his watch had been inaugurated while the NSITF board was delayed because of on-going investigation of financial impropriety by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC).
