Dele Alli is ready to strut his stuff against Colombia, with the fit-again midfielder warning that England are “not scared of anyone” at this World Cup.
Qualification for the last-16 was sealed with a game to spare after the Three Lions followed up their last-gasp win against Tunisia with a ruthless display in the shellacking of Panama.
Gareth Southgate’s second string lost to Belgium’s back-ups on Thursday, but confidence is still coursing through the squad ahead of Tuesday’s tough-looking clash against Colombia in Moscow.
“The World Cup is the highest level,” England attacking midfielder Alli said.
“The best teams around the world, the players playing against each other.
“As a team we’re not scared of anyone.
“Whatever team you put in front of us we’re not going to hide, we’ll go out there be confident in ourselves, play the way we want to play and hopefully win the game.
“Of course, like I said before, we’ve come here with the mentality we want to win it and we’re going to win it.
