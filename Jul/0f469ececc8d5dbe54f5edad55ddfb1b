All known federal might in Nigeria have been noticed to be deployed by the All Progressives Congress (APC) federal government against the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ekiti State to ensure the APC candidate, Dr. Kayoed Fayemi, wins the Saturday governorship election in the state. The Police, the Independent national Electoral Commission (INEC) and others, have been observed to have compromised their neutrality in supervising the Ekiti governorship elections. The Police unleashed unusual violence on PDP leaders and supporters, including the attack on Governor Ayodele Fayose.  After attempts to deny and cover-up the Police brutality failed, the Police admitted attacks on PDP members, admitting they were mistakes with promise not to repeat such again.  The high level of political violence displayed by the federal government controlled by the APC made the Ehiti governorship election the most unpopular election in Nigeria since 1999.
Subsequently, tThe National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) joined the league of electoral oppressive federal agencies and shut the Ekiti State Government Broadcasting Service (EBS), with immediate effect on allegation of breaching provisions of the Broadcasting Code.
The NBC claimed that the station breached the Electoral Act and Broadcasting Code by allowing Governor Ayodele Fayose declare fake results of the Ekiti governorship election in favour of his deputy and candidate of the PDP, Kolapo Olusola.
The NBC also accused the governor of using the broadcast service to make malicious and unsubstantiated comments against the Independent Electoral Commission (INEC), the police and the Department of State Services.
The Ekiti Broadcasting Service is to remain shut until further notice, it said.
